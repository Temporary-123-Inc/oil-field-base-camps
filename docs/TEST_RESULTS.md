# Temporary123 Test Results

## 2026-10-12 — Contact forms to Glide pre-release PASS

- Vercel production environment contains sensitive `GLIDE_WEBHOOK_URL` and `GLIDE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` entries; their values were not written to source or browser configuration.
- Credential scan across tracked/runtime source and the completed build found zero occurrences of the supplied webhook identifiers or token.
- Focused Vitest (`oil-field-rebuild`, `location-data`): 7/7 pass. The relay test proves exact requested payload keys, both authorization headers, canonical `https://oil-field-base-camps.com/contact-us/` URL, stripped internal fields, and calculator exclusion.
- `pnpm run typecheck`: pass. `pnpm run build`: pass; 313 indexable routes prerendered.
- Local Chromium Contact page exposes labeled and required service, duration, industry, location, start-date, consent and project-detail controls. No live submission was made before deployment because production-only secrets require a fresh Vercel deployment.
- Production commit `8d15827` / deployment `dpl_6M6Ac1DVHtdBWHmY6ay7EUy6LEqp`: READY. Live Chromium confirmed all requested Contact controls and a calculation-only calculator with no submission form. Exactly one labeled test lead was POSTed through `https://oil-field-base-camps.vercel.app/api/contact`; the server returned HTTP 200 `{ok:true}`, proving Glide accepted the webhook request. Test identity was `Codex Glide Integration Test` / `glide-test@example.com`, and its message requests removal after verification. The webhook response does not provide row data, so row-level persistence was not independently inspected.

## 2026-10-12 — Public phone replacement pre-release PASS

- Owner-supplied phone is stored as display `1-888-385-5965` and E.164 `+18883855965`.
- Active-source scan: zero instances of the former display, compact or E.164 number across runtime, API, requirements and tests.
- `pnpm run typecheck`: pass. Focused Vitest (`oil-field-rebuild`, `location-data`): 6/6 pass.
- `pnpm run build`: pass; 313 indexable routes prerendered.
- Local Chromium confirmed the new display number and exact `tel:+18883855965` value in the alert bar, hero, emergency band, footer and sticky urgent action.
- Production commit `db7a12d` / deployment `dpl_ENK8zbsnbNVL7FTdYG8uoHwrJ3Nh`: READY. Live Chromium confirmed `1-888-385-5965` and `tel:+18883855965` in the alert bar, hero, emergency band, footer and sticky urgent action.

## 2026-10-12 — Supplied shield logo and favicon pre-release PASS

- `pnpm run typecheck`: pass.
- `pnpm run build`: pass; Vite production output and 313 indexable prerendered routes completed.
- Focused Vitest (`oil-field-rebuild`, `location-data`): 6/6 pass, including header/logo/favicons/schema assets.
- Generated output contains all favicon/touch-icon links and Organization logo schema; all five branded assets are present in `dist`.
- Local Chromium desktop QA: shield decoded at 256×256 intrinsic pixels, rendered 54×54 inside the 86px header, retained the accessible `OIL FIELD BASE CAMPS` brand name, and introduced zero horizontal overflow. Visual inspection passed.
- The broad inherited `pnpm test` command remains incompatible with this repository: unrelated Temporary123 suites fail collection because their dependencies are absent, and three legacy redirect assertions conflict with this site's Vercel configuration. This is unchanged from the site-38 release and not caused by the branding change.
- Production commit `c90b7e7` / deployment `dpl_9dQ7XRj1kmVdC6jW38TT3avCRNwo`: READY. Live Chromium confirmed the decoded 256px shield, 54px desktop presentation, intact accessible brand name, explicit 32px favicon link and zero horizontal overflow. Live HEAD checks returned HTTP 200 `image/png` for the 32px favicon, 192px favicon, Apple touch icon and 256px header logo.

## 2026-09-26 — Direct-answer guide pre-release

34/34 engine/content tests passed. Full TypeScript/Vite/prerender build passed (745 pages + 404). Local built-site Playwright 4/4 passed at 375/1440px: phone text and tel link, weekend hours with dispatch caveat, pricing disclaimer, unknown question fallback, contact drawer, unchanged homepage brand/H1/canonical and zero page errors. Secret scan: 1161 files, no findings. No inquiry submitted; unchanged email/backend excluded.

## 2026-09-26 — Homepage brand correction LIVE VERIFIED

Production commit 3518096 / deployment dpl_6V5jHr614xLHnDNzGytvPQ9wNtam. Full build and secret scan passed. Completed-build local Playwright 2/2 and live temporary123.com Playwright 2/2 passed: visible Temporary123 nationwide introduction, availability/dispatch caveat, no specialist referral or entity text in paragraph, unchanged H1/canonical, no horizontal overflow, zero page errors at 375/1440px. Live sitemap identical to build, 744 URLs. Initial premature preview run failed before prerender finished; completed-build rerun passed. No forms submitted; unchanged backend/email not retested. Post-release record local only.

## 2026-09-26 — Homepage brand correction pre-release

Completed-build rerun: both Playwright checks passed at 375px and 1440px with zero page errors. Safe to release the scoped paragraph correction.

TypeScript and full production build passed (745 pages + 404); secret scan passed with zero findings. Added mobile/desktop Playwright regression for Temporary123 lead copy, availability caveat, removed referral/entity text, unchanged H1/canonical and horizontal overflow. Initial browser attempt started before prerender finished and preview server failed on missing dist/404.html; rerun against completed build required. Production verification pending. No form submissions; backend unchanged.

## 2026-09-26 — Rental guide production PASS

Deployment dpl_28muEh775JKN5CSsjji1kKtTiPss, commit 54fc0b6, temporary123.com. GUIDE_TEST_URL=https://temporary123.com with packages/website-guide/tests/deployed.config.ts: 4/4 Chromium tests pass (320, 375, 768, 1440px). Pricing and fallback render; native dialog fits; contact action opens visible contact-drawer and quote-island; zero page errors. Mobile screenshot visually checked. Sitemap byte-identical to pre-release production baseline, 744 URLs; homepage canonical https://temporary123.com/; homepage, calculator, robots return 200; nonexistent route 404. All 13 guide action destinations return 200. Local release checks: 19 engine, 74 site and 6 browser tests; full 745-page plus 404 build pass. No form submission or downstream email/persistence verification; feature does not send or store chat. Screenshot: isolated release packages/website-guide/test-results/temporary-375.png.

## 2026-09-26 — Modular guide release validation

Production baseline aa5dfbb. npm ci from unchanged lockfile. Full npm run build: TypeScript, Vite, 745 pages plus 404 pass; existing Zod annotation warnings only. Package build and 19 engine tests pass. Site suite: initial concurrent build/test run had one 5-second migration timeout; unchanged test passed in full serial rerun (74/74). Six Chromium browser tests pass with production-compiled assets and host CSP: standalone alternate brand, 320/375/768/1440px, pricing, unknown-query fallback, quote drawer visibility, keyboard/focus, safe text rendering, isolation, history and cleanup. Generated sitemap is byte-identical to live sitemap (744 URLs). No inquiry submission, database mutation or email test; existing form is opened only. Deployment verification pending.

## 3-stall + 1 ADA selected production photography — 2026-09-24 (LIVE PASS)

- Visual selection: reviewed all eight owner-supplied files at original detail. Retained seven compatible views: four interiors and three exteriors, including the exterior with three standard side entrances and the rear larger entrance. Excluded review ID `28.08`, whose exterior visibly shows four standard side doors.
- Runtime: restored only the seven selected originals and fourteen responsive WebP derivatives; regenerated the verified manifest and exact-route gallery mapping. The caption identifies selected owner-supplied photography and asks customers to confirm the available unit, ramp, dimensions, accessibility requirements and utility plan with the quote.
- Preserved scope: the H1, URL, equipment specifications/copy, metadata/indexing, forms and unrelated galleries are unchanged.
- Unit verification: `npx vitest run tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts tests/ownerImageRollout.test.tsx tests/locationCarouselImages.test.ts` passed 89/89 assertions, including exact seven-image order, byte integrity, the generic ADA grouping and absence of the excluded image/hash.
- Build verification: `npm run build` passed TypeScript and Vite and generated 745 static pages plus 404.
- Browser verification: an initial attempt correctly failed after Playwright reused an unrelated server already occupying port 4173. A fresh isolated preview on port 4174 passed the exact-route test 1/1: HTTP 200, visible carousel, seven slides, no pending-verification panel, no `28.08`, selected-photo caption and a decoded lead image.
- Release: runtime commit `d8c4b97` was pushed to official `main`; Vercel production deployment `dpl_Dmre4VmNBL32hdh3B5dp8By7tAmx` reached Ready.
- Live browser verification: the exact-route Playwright test passed 1/1 against `https://temporary123.com`, confirming HTTP 200, seven slides, no pending-verification panel, no excluded `28.08` image, the selected-photo caption and a decoded lead image.
- Live visual verification: a fresh cache-busted production tab visibly rendered the owner-supplied interior photography, seven thumbnails and the `2 of 7` carousel counter. The preserved H1 remained `3-Stall + 1 ADA Shower and Restroom Combination Trailer Rental`.

## 3-stall + 1 ADA disputed-gallery withdrawal — 2026-09-24 (LOCAL PASS; DEPLOYED AND LIVE VERIFIED)

- Root cause: the earlier review treated the source folder name as authoritative. Cross-folder SHA-256 comparison subsequently proved that four of its eight files are exact duplicates of files in the `8 Stalls + 1 ADA` folder, while visual inspection found an exterior with four standard doors plus a larger room.
- Correction: remove the disputed originals, responsive derivatives and manifest classification; do not substitute another unverified model. The route must render `Exact equipment photography is pending verification.` with no service carousel.
- Preserved scope: H1, URL, equipment copy, metadata/indexing, forms and unrelated galleries are unchanged.
- Unit verification: `npx vitest run tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts tests/ownerImageRollout.test.tsx` passed 18/18 tests across two files.
- Build verification: `npm run build` passed TypeScript and Vite and generated 745 static pages plus 404.
- Clean-preview HTTP verification on isolated port 4317 returned HTTP 200, included `Exact equipment photography is pending verification`, omitted `data-service-carousel`, and omitted the disputed asset reference.
- Browser verification: the exact 3+1 correction test and the neighboring 8+1 disclosure test passed in `tests/browser/owner-image-rollout.spec.ts`. One unrelated broad-options test timed out attempting to scroll a hidden element; no failure occurred on the corrected route.
- Release: runtime commit `5fb9942` was pushed to official `main`; Vercel production deployment `dpl_BMunCtXzfmz5vPgbEm8qoetXVV9B` reached Ready after building that exact revision.
- Live HTTP verification: the canonical production URL returned HTTP 200, retained the exact `3-Stall + 1 ADA Shower and Restroom Combination Trailer Rental` H1, included the pending-verification notice, omitted `data-service-carousel`, and omitted the disputed asset hash.
- Live browser verification: a fresh cache-busted production load rendered `PHOTO REVIEW IN PROGRESS` and no gallery. An already-open browser tab initially retained the superseded cached DOM; the fresh load and HTTP response both confirmed the deployed state.

## Existing public-page indexability — 2026-09-22 (LOCAL PASS; RELEASE BLOCKED)

- Source isolation: official `origin/main` revision `4d05061` on branch `codex/public-page-indexability`, workspace `D:\Temporary123-public-indexing-20260922`. The dirty primary checkout and its unfinished city/photo work were not included. Official remote `main` still pointed to `4d05061` at the final remote check.
- Same-day production baseline: 745 registered routes, 25 `index,follow`, and 720 `noindex,follow` (719 public pages plus the dashboard). This is a live eligibility snapshot, not current Google index inclusion.
- Scope: all 744 existing public routes now emit `index,follow`, exact HTTPS apex self-canonicals and production sitemap membership. `/seo-dashboard/` remains `noindex,follow` without a canonical. Missing URLs still return 404 with `noindex,nofollow`; API/private/admin/preview paths cannot enter canonical or sitemap output.
- Route parity: the complete generated audit compared the original `4d05061` route inventory with the candidate, finding zero added or removed routes. `vercel.json` is byte-for-byte unchanged in Git. Every public route has exactly one H1 and is reachable through crawlable HTML links from `/`.
- `npm test -- --no-file-parallelism` passed **74/74**. The initial parallel run timed out on an existing archive-read test on this drive; the complete sequential run passed without loosening its assertions or timeout.
- `npm run build` passed TypeScript, Vite and prerender for **745 routes plus 404**. Production audit: **744 indexable / 744 sitemap entries / 744 reachable public routes / zero errors**.
- A separate build with `VERCEL_ENV=preview` passed: **zero indexable / zero sitemap URLs / all 745 registered routes noindex / zero audit errors**. The environment variable was removed and the production build/audit were rerun successfully at `2026-09-22T14:18:38.564Z`.
- Browser/HTTP QA: `npm run test:e2e -- tests/browser/public-indexability.spec.ts tests/browser/seo.spec.ts --workers=1`, using installed Chrome, passed **6/6**. Coverage includes every public URL returning direct HTTP 200 with the expected indexing metadata, 12 representative routes at both 1440 px and 390 px with no page errors, dashboard/error exclusions, substantive generated content and known-backlink destination checks. Local host headers intentionally keep localhost nonindexable; this is not production deployment proof.
- `npm run check:seo` passed **746 HTML files, 96,706 local links, 12,342 local images, 746 unique titles and 746 unique descriptions**, with zero reported problems. The regional-link checker was aligned with the already-live same-state-only change: a state with only three regions must expose two truthful alternatives, not a cross-state third link.
- `npm run check:links` passed **745 pages, zero missing or case-mismatched internal targets**. `npm run check:headlines` passed **548 unique location H1s**. `npm run check:cities` passed the **19,702-place source data, 246 directories and five reviewed city pages**; this does not mean 19,702 new pages were published. Secret scanning reported zero findings.
- Release boundary: `npm run check:release` fails with `security evidence contains unresolved release controls`. The checked-in evidence still marks **AUTHZ, CORS_HEADERS, APP_CHECK, INTEGRATIONS, SECRETS, DEPLOY, OBSERVE and RECOVERY** blocked. The old evidence also contains stale environment descriptions; neither a new build nor source inspection validates those provider/runtime controls. No security status, enforcement, inquiry flag or release checker was weakened.
- Final verification: `git diff --check` passed and `npm run check:secrets` scanned **1,120 source/build files with zero findings**. `npm run check:security` independently rejected the eight blocked controls plus old evidence references outside the required `security/` report directory. These are pre-existing evidence deficiencies, not proof that the production features are failing; they still prevent a fully verified release.
- No Git push, Vercel deployment, Search Console indexing request or live form submission was performed for this change. Google crawl/index/ranking outcomes remain unverified. Evidence: `audit/public-indexability-2026-09-22/`.

## State-contained regional links — 2026-09-22 (LIVE PASS)

- Removed the explicit Arizona, Delaware and Indiana cross-state related-region fallbacks; every returned related region must now match the source page's state.
- `npx vitest run tests/seasonal.test.ts` passed 8/8 assertions, including all-region same-state coverage; the full configured `npm test` suite passed 71/71.
- `npm run typecheck` passed. `npm run build` passed and generated 745 pages plus 404.
- Generated HTML samples for California Bay Area, Northern Arizona and Northern Delaware contain only same-state links inside `nav.region-nearby`.
- Commit `3c217c5` deployed through READY production deployment `dpl_EMP4nJGnZnwtqHDXnmNZYdgjXw2y`, aliased to `temporary123.com`.
- Live California Bay Area, Northern Arizona and Northern Delaware pages returned HTTP 200; their `nav.region-nearby` links stayed inside California, Arizona and Delaware respectively. The staged pages retained `noindex,follow` without canonicals.
- Live `sitemap.xml` returned HTTP 200 with 25 URLs. Command Center Trailers and the historical Houston mobile-kitchen URL both remained HTTP 200, `index,follow`, self-canonical and included in the sitemap.
- Preserved route inventory, HTTP behavior, H1s, canonicals, robots directives and sitemap policy.

## Vercel Web Analytics — 2026-09-20 (LIVE PASS)

- Installed `@vercel/analytics` 2.0.1 and invoked `inject()` once from the global browser entry point.
- `npm ci` completed from the updated lockfile. `npm run build` passed TypeScript and generated 745 production pages plus 404.
- `npm test` passed all 62 application tests. `npm run check:secrets` scanned 1,110 files with zero findings.
- Headless Chromium loaded `/`, `/contact-us/`, and `/service-areas/kansas/western-kansas/`; all three returned HTTP 200, initialized the Vercel analytics client, requested `/_vercel/insights/script.js`, and had zero page or console errors.
- Release: commit `a0d896b` was pushed to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` main. Production deployment `dpl_BoFRyqBBpq92dXKqc4CirqswhRye` reached READY and was aliased to `temporary123.com`.
- Live Chromium loaded `/`, `/contact-us/`, and `/service-areas/kansas/western-kansas/`; all three returned HTTP 200, initialized `window.va`, loaded `https://temporary123.com/_vercel/insights/script.js` with HTTP 200, and produced zero page or console errors.
- Boundary: the integration and live collection script are verified, but the Vercel dashboard's aggregated visitor/page-view counters may update asynchronously and were not represented as populated during this release check.

## Whole-site QA continuation — 2026-09-19 (LIVE PASS; SECURITY EVIDENCE PARTIAL)

- Isolation: all source changes and builds used `C:\Users\Charles\.codex\worktrees\whole-site-qa-origin\Temporary 123`; the dirty primary checkout and its unfinished 1,000-city draft were not changed or published.
- Runtime inventory: the independent browser pass covered 13 representative templates at three viewports, 39/39 presentations, plus one safe interaction flow. The dedicated equipment test covered 42 routes and 14 modal/gallery presentations at both desktop and 390 px mobile with decoded images, current captions, phone contract and zero same-origin resource errors.
- Source fixes: Contact Us breadcrumb extraction now preserves spaces across JSX line breaks; six military seals across 36 appearances and two restroom references have truthful nonempty alternatives; nine equipment pages and 12 overlapping workforce pages have route-specific metadata; the gallery browser fixture is embedded rather than depending on an absent local QA file.
- Contact selector: generated `/contact-us/` contains `Mobile Kitchen Trailers`, `Dishwashing Trailers`, `Refrigeration Trailers`, `Restroom & Shower Trailers`, `Sleeper Trailers`, `Laundry Trailers`, and `Sink Trailers`. The three broad choices and every submitted value remain unchanged.
- Automated checks: `npm test` passed **62/62**; `npm run test:rules` passed **7/7** against the isolated Firebase RTDB emulator; `npm run typecheck` passed; `npm run build` generated **745 pages plus 404**.
- SEO gate: `npm run check:seo` checked 746 HTML files, 96,715 local links and 12,342 local images with **746 unique titles, 746 unique descriptions and zero problems**. The orphan rule remains strict for indexable routes and intentionally excludes nonindex utilities/staged content. The controlled rollout remains 25 indexable routes; historical recovery reports 625 of 98,253 source records and is not claimed complete.
- Crawl/content gates: `npm run check:links` passed 745 pages with zero capitalization or missing-target findings; `npm run check:headlines` passed 548/548 unique location H1s; `npm run check:cities` passed 19,702 census places, 246 region directories and five reviewed city pages; `npm run check:secrets` scanned 1,141 files with zero findings.
- Vercel domain routing: after changing `www.temporary123.com` to redirect to `temporary123.com`, a live audit passed **745/745** first-hop 308 redirects to the exact apex path, **745/745** final HTTP 200 responses, exact query preservation, and zero chains, loops or failures. All 25 indexable URLs passed. `/sitemap-review.xml` remains an owner-review artifact that must not be submitted, and Oklahoma Panhandle remains an intentional noindex staged exception.
- Security boundary: production dependency audit has no high/critical findings and two moderate transitive findings through Firebase Admin (`@google-cloud/storage` → `gaxios` → `uuid`). `AUTHZ`, `CORS_HEADERS`, `APP_CHECK`, `INTEGRATIONS`, `SECRETS`, `DEPLOY`, `OBSERVE`, and `RECOVERY` remain blocked until their required staging/provider evidence is collected; the security checker was not weakened.
- External-action boundary: no production form submission was made during this continuation. Prior form/Resend acceptance evidence remains valid, but inbox receipt was not rechecked.
- Release: commit `93a2a49` was pushed only to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` main. Vercel production deployment `dpl_G2ABdYFMKHF8R57gkoJztjD3pf9s` reached READY after a 2m 5s build.
- Live Contact Us: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://temporary123.com npx playwright test tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts --workers=1` passed **1/1**, opening the production drawer, verifying all seven trailer labels plus the three broad choices, and selecting every unchanged submitted value.
- Live galleries: the production 42-route plus 14-modal equipment regression passed **2/2** at 1440 px and 390 px, including decoded images, current captions, phone contract and modal/lightbox behavior.
- Live metadata/routing: `/equipment-rental/sleeper-trailers/` and `/remote-workforce-house-company-in-alabama/` returned HTTP 200 with their corrected unique titles and self-canonicals. `www.temporary123.com/contact-us/?qa=redirect` returned a direct 308 to the exact apex path and query.

## Contact Us trailer labels — 2026-09-19 (LIVE PASS)

- Source scope: only the Contact Us selector's visible labels changed; submitted values, `server/schema.ts`, inquiry behavior, shared service names outside the form, URLs, and indexing were preserved.
- `npx vitest run tests/contactFacilities.test.tsx`: **11/11 passed**, covering every selector label and every unchanged server-accepted value.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed and generated **745 pages plus 404**.
- Browser: the first Playwright attempt reused an unrelated stale server already listening on port 4173 and correctly failed on the old `Mobile kitchens` label. A fresh preview of this build on isolated port 4327 then passed `tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts` **1/1**, opening the actual Contact Us drawer, verifying all ten visible options, and selecting each unchanged value.
- Release: commit `a55ca90` was pushed only to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` main. Vercel production deployment `dpl_ATN5UCHnp2ujUp8AUNiU8FVsrpZH` reached READY after a 1m 43s build.
- Live browser: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://temporary123.com npx playwright test tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts --reporter=line`: **1/1 passed** in 5.9s, opening the production Contact Us drawer, verifying all ten labels, and selecting every unchanged value.
- Boundary: no live inquiry was submitted because this release changes display labels only; production email delivery was not retested.

## Whole-site production-baseline QA — 2026-09-19 (LIVE PASS; RELEASE GATE PARTIAL)

- Isolation: audited `origin/main` in `C:\Users\Charles\.codex\worktrees\whole-site-qa-origin\Temporary 123`; the dirty primary checkout and its separate 1,000-city draft were not used or overwritten.
- Build and unit checks: `npm test -- --run` passed 56/56; `npm run typecheck` passed; `npm run build` generated 745 pages plus 404.
- Crawl checks: `npm run check:links` scanned 745 pages with 0 capitalization issues and 0 missing internal targets. `npm run check:headlines` found 548 location pages and 548 unique headlines. `npm run check:cities` found 19,702 census places, 246 regional directories, five reviewed city pages and zero issues.
- Content repairs: `/temporary-facilities-2/` now permanently resolves to `/planning/`; two stale handwashing image references use an existing asset; ten migrated placeholder/file-name alts use visually verified descriptions; duplicate ADA-combination titles now include their 3-stall or 8-stall configuration.
- Dashboard runtime: headless Chromium loaded `http://127.0.0.1:4174/seo-dashboard/#workflow`, selected `Next checks`, and recorded zero console or page errors after replacing mismatched hydration with an interactive mount over the prerendered fallback.
- Secret scan: 1,107 source/built text files scanned with zero complete credential findings. A BEGIN marker alone is no longer treated as an exposed key; the scanner still requires a complete key-shaped block.
- Known release boundary: `npm run check:security` and therefore `npm run check:release` remain blocked by unresolved pre-existing security-evidence controls. The SEO report also retains legacy duplicate-title/description findings, the intentionally unlinked noindex dashboard, and an incomplete historical migration count. These results are documented, not suppressed.
- Release: commit `4f7bf1c` was pushed to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` main. Vercel deployment `dpl_HJTTMT5Ys7DHxukf5Y1zUYy3oiVV` reached READY and serves `temporary123.com`.
- Production runtime: `/temporary-facilities-2/` returns a permanent redirect to `/planning/`; `/seo-dashboard/#workflow` loaded with the expected heading/tab state and zero browser console/page errors; `/sitemap.xml` returned HTTP 200.
- Indexing workbook crawl: all 327 controlled-rollout URLs returned HTTP 200. Batch 1 contains 25/25 pages with matching self-canonicals, `index,follow`, and sitemap membership. The remaining 302/302 URLs are intentionally staged with `noindex,follow` outside the sitemap. Classification issues: zero; formula-error scan: zero.
- External boundaries: Google index inclusion was not inferred from crawlability and remains `Not verified in Search Console`. Deep `www` paths can return HTTP 200 with `noindex,follow` rather than consistently redirecting to apex. Contact and quote forms were not resubmitted during this SEO verification because downstream messages are external actions and require action-time confirmation.

## Service-area gallery review-banner removal — 2026-09-18 (LIVE PASS)

- Exact scope: 648 service-area and modal presentations inventoried; 557 contained one of seven internal review context variants and were changed (477 public route presentations, 40 full-map modals, 40 compact-map modals). The remaining 91 presentations were unaffected.
- Source and generated output: exhaustive SSR passed 648/648; all 656 generated HTML files contained zero `.location-gallery-context` elements and zero cited review phrases.
- Local verification: 241/241 focused assertions, 45/45 application tests, 655-page link check, release check, and the 655-page plus 404 build passed. Browser QA passed all 12 representative desktop/mobile route presentations and all 100 state-modal presentations.
- Release: commit `68d2f6b` was pushed only to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` main. Temporary 123 team project `temporary-123` deployment `dpl_7TvgbnRjjsVReBkmD55kzrm7dXkb` reached READY and was aliased to `temporary123.com`.
- Production verification: the live representative page source contained zero removed banner classes and zero review phrases. Playwright repeated all 12 route presentations plus all 50 full-map and 50 compact-map modals; 3/3 suites passed.
- Preservation: customer-facing product headings and individual captions remain, as do images, truthful alt text, H1s, URLs, canonicals and indexing settings.

## Dedicated service gallery-caption correction — 2026-09-18 (LIVE PASS)

- Scope inventory: 33 dedicated service-detail routes; 13 used the generic reviewed-photo fallback and 20 already used image-specific disclosures.
- SSR and production regression: 33/33 routes contain neither `Reviewed equipment reference images` nor `Photos do not establish availability or a deployment in this location`.
- Caption acceptance: 13/13 replacements contain Commercial Project and Base Camp context, the exact page equipment name, Rental or Lease, weekly/monthly/yearly inquiry terms, a model-specific benefit/detail, and `Call us now at +1 (800) 443-5212, available 24/7.`
- Focused tests: 42/42 passed across `dedicatedServiceGalleryCopy`, `serviceHeroImages`, `ownerImageRollout`, and `equipmentMissingPhotos`.
- Application tests: 45/45 passed with `npm test`.
- Production build: passed TypeScript, Vite, and prerender; 655 pages plus 404 generated.
- Local browser QA: 26/26 desktop/mobile presentations passed across the 13 changed routes; every response was HTTP 200, each lead image decoded with truthful nonempty alt text, each caption met the acceptance checks, and zero console/page errors occurred. Evidence: `work/qa/dedicated-service-captions-20260918/browser-results.json`.
- Production browser QA: 26/26 desktop/mobile presentations passed on `temporary123.com` with the same status, caption, decoded-image, alt-text, and console checks. The complete live route scan passed 33/33. Evidence: `work/qa/dedicated-service-captions-20260918/live-browser-results.json` and `live-route-results.json`.
- Release: commit `349f011` was pushed only to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` main. Vercel production deployment `dpl_HfjDn5HnFEpGvdfs81EtZWJjiBdn` is READY and verified on `temporary123.com`.
- Preservation: no H1, URL, canonical, indexing directive, gallery image, or alt-text source changed.

## Equipment Rental missing-photo production release — 2026-09-18

- Scope: homepage Restroom card and the `/equipment-rental/` catalogue entries for Restroom trailers, Dining structures, both 22 ft shower trailer ten-stall entries, and Stair rentals.
- `npx vitest run tests/equipmentMissingPhotos.test.tsx tests/servicesCardPhotos.test.tsx tests/allPageAlignment.test.tsx`: 3 files passed, 65/65 tests passed. `npm run typecheck`: pass.
- `npm run build`: pass; Vite build and static generation completed for 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Existing nonfatal JSON import-attribute and Rollup annotation warnings remain.
- Local Chromium at 1440x900 and 390x844: 22/22 checks passed, including decoded images and no console or page errors.
- Production deployment `dpl_HLZTgejPHmhNHUTu3xGUqWqYi29H`: READY. Live Chromium at 1440x900 and 390x844: 26/26 checks passed across all requested catalogue cards and the homepage Restroom card, including the visible 20 ft versus 22 ft disclosure and no console or page errors.
- Live asset verification: 16/16 new responsive WebP URLs returned HTTP 200. `/equipment-rental/` returned HTTP 200 with H1 `Nationwide Temporary Facility and Equipment Rental` and the existing `noindex,follow` robots setting.
- Remaining boundary: no exact 22 ft ten-stall shower photograph exists in the repository or supplied Drive assets. The two catalogue entries therefore use the verified 20 ft five-stall shower-only reference with a visible disclosure; exact configuration and floor plan still require quote confirmation.

## Urgent Olympic caption and skill refinement — 2026-09-17

## Service-area gallery review-banner removal — local verification, 2026-09-18

- Exact resolver inventory: 648 service-area and map-modal presentations; 557 affected (477 public routes, 40 full-map modals, 40 compact-map modals) and 91 without the review paragraph. Context counts: directory 247, ADA reference 45, kitchen alternatives 54, laundry 50, man camp 56, shower reference 52, sleeper options 53.
- `npx vitest run ...`: 241/241 focused tests passed, including all 648 server-rendered presentations with zero remaining `.location-gallery-context` elements or banned review phrases. `npm test`: 45/45 passed.
- `npm run check:links`: 655 pages, zero issues. `npm run check:release`: pass. `npm run build`: 655 pages plus 404. Scan of all 656 generated HTML files found zero banner classes and zero cited review phrases.
- Playwright: 12/12 representative service-area presentations passed at 1440 px and 390 px; the full-map and compact-map suites passed all 50 states each (100/100 modal presentations). Product headings and individual captions remained present.
- Local evidence only at this entry; production deployment and live checks are pending.

- `npm run typecheck`: pass. `npx vitest run tests/olympicPeninsulaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 7/7 pass.
- Exact-route `olympic-peninsula-ssr.mjs`: three current captions with unchanged H1; pass. Local browser `olympic-peninsula-browser.mjs`: 6/6 desktop/mobile gallery checks, images loaded and no page errors.
- Repacked the same `LOCAL SKILL CHARLES_IMPORTANT.zip`: seven entries preserved, ZIP integrity and updated content byte comparison passed.
- Local preview port 4313 uses a frozen page shell with current captions inserted because concurrent work removed `dist`. Source integration passed separately; this is not a combined build or live deployment.

## Olympic Peninsula caption quality pass — local verification, 2026-09-17

- `npm run typecheck`: pass.
- `npx vitest run tests/olympicPeninsulaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 7/7 pass.
- `node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-ssr.mjs`: exact route renders all three revised captions with unchanged H1; pass.
- `node work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-browser.mjs`: 6/6 desktop/mobile gallery checks; captions present, images loaded, no page errors. Screenshots and JSON saved in the same QA directory.
- Concurrent work removed `dist` during the check. Local preview on port 4313 now falls back to a frozen page shell and inserts the current three captions; source integration was checked separately with exact-route SSR. This is a local copy preview, not a combined production build or deployment.

## Caption quality skill package — local verification, 2026-09-17

- Updated installed `temporary123-portfolio-rebuild` skill and original `LOCAL SKILL CHARLES_IMPORTANT.zip` with the approved Panhandle caption example and guidance for concise, distinct, verified customer copy.
- Verified required skill frontmatter fields, preserved all seven ZIP entries, checked ZIP CRC/integrity, and byte-compared three updated package entries against the installed skill. Preserved an original ZIP backup beside the package.
- `quick_validate.py` could not start because PyYAML is unavailable in both available Python runtimes; no validator pass is claimed. No website behavior changed or deployment occurred in this task.

## Olympic Peninsula caption revision — local verification, 2026-09-17

- Charles requested unique, customer-focused descriptions and the existing "Call us now ... available 24/7" assistance CTA. Only the three exact-page captions and their tests changed; the prior Olympic Peninsula sample below is superseded.
- `npm run typecheck`: pass. `npx vitest run tests/olympicPeninsulaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 7/7 pass. `node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-ssr.mjs`: 3/3 exact-route captions with original H1 and new CTA passed.
- Restarted localhost preview at http://127.0.0.1:4313/service-areas/washington/olympic-peninsula/. Browser check at 1440/390 px: 6/6 group checks passed; tabs worked, main images decoded, new captions appeared, zero page errors. The preview uses existing prerendered markup with these three current captions inserted; no full integrated build or live check is claimed. No commit, push or deployment.

## Olympic Peninsula image-caption sample — local verification, 2026-09-17

- `npm run typecheck`: pass. `npx vitest run tests/olympicPeninsulaGalleryCopy.test.ts tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 7/7 pass.
- `node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-ssr.mjs`: the exact route rendered its original H1 and all three dedicated captions in the intended equipment order.
- Local review server at http://127.0.0.1:4313/service-areas/washington/olympic-peninsula/ returned HTTP 200. `node work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/olympic-peninsula-browser.mjs`: 6/6 desktop/mobile group checks passed at 1440 and 390 px; all main images decoded, tabs worked, captions had rental/lease opening and phone CTA, zero page errors. Screenshots and JSON results are in the same QA directory.
- Preview server serves the existing prerendered page with only the three current caption strings inserted and the older app bundle disabled so it cannot replace them. The exact-route SSR check separately verifies current source integration. This is a local caption review, not a full integrated build or production check. No commit, push or deployment.

## Service-area gallery copy — local verification, 2026-09-17

- `npm run typecheck`: pass. `npx vitest run tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts`: 4/4 pass, covering single equipment, separate broad equipment groups, leasing intent, and non-location no-op.
- `node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/audit.mjs`: 548 route renders and 100 full/compact state modal templates; 648/648 presentations with zero reported caption/alt issues. 381 non-Panhandle gallery groups appear on 262 routes; 126 groups appear in 84 modal presentations. Another 284 non-Panhandle routes have no gallery. The hub's 50 inert modal templates and the existing Panhandle captions are counted in the raw 572-group report but are not new route-caption changes.
- Browser check attempted at 1440/390 px, but the local Vite server did not answer the first Alabama navigation within 30 seconds; a direct `curl -I` also received zero bytes within 10 seconds. No browser or live deployment pass is claimed. `browser.mjs` is retained as a repeatable check for a responsive server.
- No H1, URL, canonical, robots, homepage, image identity, or image-alt data source file was edited. Production behavior is not verified; no commit, push, or deployment occurred.

## Panhandle CTA correction — final local and live verification, 2026-09-17

Standard TypeScript/Vite/prerender build passed for 651 pages plus 404. Focused tests passed 209/209; application tests passed 44/44. Generated preservation audit checked 651 pages and 100 state-map presentations: zero failures, H1/intro/title/canonical/robots preserved, exactly two new captions on the Oklahoma Panhandle page. Production input delta is only src/panhandleGalleryCopy.ts.

Local and live browser runs each passed at 1440/390 px: 8 page checks, 4 product panels, 8 decoded-image displays, 4 Oklahoma map checks, zero failures or JavaScript errors. Separate 30 ft trailer and 20 ft container groups and image alt text retained. Exact rendered copy includes all three rental durations, rental/lease leading phrases and the published 24/7 phone CTA; rejected quote-confirmation disclaimers absent.

Read-only final Vercel inspection confirms READY dpl_6ykocrDRHboUz1zNH2Em9b164U5Q serves temp123-nine.vercel.app. The live alias was updated by an existing release during this lane's verification; no duplicate promotion was performed. The separately observed dpl_JBnwQgnt5e7vwV6Zd8MMgca8vkHR URL requires authentication and is not treated as successful public verification. Complete remote-source fingerprint equivalence is not claimed.

Initial raw caption assertion failed because the existing prerender normalizes punctuation and telephone formatting. Rendered expectations were corrected; no runtime change was made to satisfy that harness issue. Historical failed assertions and cached-CLI lookup failure are retained. Exact evidence and visual-review limitations: work/qa/panhandle-lease-20260917/cta-final/REPORT.md, audit.json, local-browser.json, live-browser.json, release-reconciliation.json and alias-final.log.

## Panhandle laundry captions and metadata — local verification
- Build/typecheck passed; generated 651 pages plus 404.
- Two new focused tests passed. Laundry gallery regression run passed 108 tests (54 current tests plus a 54-test archived copy discovered by Vitest).
- Local browser: one canonical to https://temporary123.com/service-areas/oklahoma/panhandle/; robots noindex,follow preserved; both revised rental captions present; Service schema uses laundry trailer and laundry container rental, with Panhandle/Oklahoma areaServed.
- Trailer main image loaded; container main image loaded after selecting its product tab. JSON-LD parsed successfully. No image assets or ordering changed.
- No deployment performed by this task. Full SEO audit launched separately; completion is not claimed here.

## 2026-09-17 — Latest shared-tree production-alias release

- Deployment `dpl_DqJgJTcMxMUKE7CUeAFX26jwXCNx` READY; immutable URL https://temp123-mxikekck8-cc-devs.vercel.app; existing alias https://temp123-nine.vercel.app.
- Vercel build passed: TypeScript, Vite, 651 static pages plus 404. Existing import-attribute/annotation warnings remain non-fatal.
- Targeted H1/description suite: 91 passed. Local typecheck passed.
- Live homepage, equipment-rental, Port Angeles and SEO dashboard returned 200. Inventory HTML contains the updated equipment rental introduction. All retained noindex, follow.
- Existing calculator Playwright tests stopped on ambiguous State label selectors (also match City placeholder); no app fix inferred from this test defect. Independent live browser checks using exact select names passed on homepage and rental-calculator: Washington/Port Angeles selection, mobile-kitchen 25ft estimate $6,490 with valid dates, state change clears city, Alaska/Anchorage selection.
- Recursive secret scan did not complete and was stopped; no successful secret-scan claim. No full-site runtime, contact delivery, provider credentials or Google indexing verification performed in this release task.

## 2026-09-17 — City dropdown production-alias verification

- Existing CC Devs/temp123 deployment `dpl_DE5mTkuYS9bnLzcL3T11L9fNbKqB`, immutable URL https://temp123-ad2vteq2m-cc-devs.vercel.app, aliased to https://temp123-nine.vercel.app.
- Vercel build passed: 651 pages plus 404, draft/noindex retained. Existing non-fatal import/annotation warnings remain.
- Live Playwright `calculator-city-dropdown.spec.ts`: 2 passed (30.1s), homepage and `/rental-calculator/`. All 50 states match source city options; 19,523 distinct state-city pairs in supplied dataset. City disabled before state selection, no free-text city input, prior city cleared on state change, new city selectable.
- `.vercelignore` excludes local QA/work and old build folders; no files deleted. These tests do not certify unrelated dashboard, contact, or gallery behavior.

### 2026-09-16 — Actual multifunctional placements in existing man-camp galleries (LOCAL)

- Scope: two substitutions inside existing photo groups on 42 dedicated location pages and seven states in each map (14 modal presentations). Group count stays three; third shower-only set, standalone products, April exceptions, laundry clarity and removed hub/directory/category additions are preserved.
- TypeScript, formatting and JavaScript syntax passed. 227 focused tests passed (43 new placement checks); 44 application tests passed with 30s timeout / one worker. Production build: 651 pages plus 404, with existing non-fatal import/annotation warnings.
- 36 Playwright tests passed on the frozen 4209 build. Every affected page/modal checked at 1440px and 390px: 112 presentations and 224 full-image displays with correct product title, caption, alt, original 1434x1097 source, object-fit contain and close behavior. All 100 map modal presentations exercised in the general regression suite. No recorded page errors, failed same-origin images or unexpected contact sends.
- Exhaustive current-source/render/HTTP audit: 548 service-area URLs + 100 modals, 648 PASS / 0 FAIL. Gallery groups remain isolated, deduplicated and interior-before-exterior within each product. 75 assigned asset paths returned 200; six new original/responsive responses byte-matched local files. 247 navigation routes intentionally have no image section; 38 modular-kitchen pages remain pending.
- Existing H1s and text outside the galleries compared unchanged against this task's preflight source baseline. Existing route inventory retained. Original image manifest, bytes/model identities, release settings and all unrelated photo assignments preserved. Actual source edits: content/equipment-photo-policy.json, content/equipment-photo-additions.json, src/LocationImageCarousel.tsx; new tests: multifunctionalPlacement.test.tsx and browser/multifunctional-placement.spec.ts.
- Candidate: .temp/multifunctional-placement-20260916/dist at http://127.0.0.1:4209. Base main HEAD 8ad98dba33ef6d9b7b1e64028da3fc639bd7fd9a, uncommitted. Scoped source fingerprint f25c4a3cd33efe24fdd8ebc44e0df4ff0b50a6b63dd35807d4cfeeeed8fd15ca. Full exact inventory/hashes/evidence: audit/multifunctional-placement-2026-09-16/; screenshots/logs: work/qa/multifunctional-placement-20260916/.
- Boundary: later concurrent Equipment.tsx, main.tsx, stateGuides.ts and service-details.json corrections were inspected and preserved, not overwritten or folded into this frozen candidate. Their combined root runtime is unverified by this task. No commit, push, deployment or live-QA claim. Non-Chromium/native-device acceptance remains separate.

### 2026-09-16 — Two new multifunctional source images, preparation stage (LOCAL)

- Fully enumerated both new public Drive folders; downloaded all two PNGs, 1434x1097 each, 4,693,898 bytes total; no pagination, omitted images or decoding failures. Original receipts and SHA256 evidence: work/drive-assets-new-2026-09-16/manifest.json and work/qa/new-equipment-photos-20260916/recheck-all.json.
- Added explicit source batch, two isolated models and exact-title matching, original public copies and four responsive WebP files. All previous 154 image-use records and previous model data compare unchanged.
- Source-stage final TypeScript/production build passed (651 pages plus 404), 184 focused tests and 44 application tests passed. Four isolated component browser presentations (two products at 1440/390px) passed for original resolution, uncropped image, product title/caption/alt, Escape/close and no recorded console/network errors. An initial missing lightbox product label was fixed only for the two new IDs; initial/final logs retained.
- These fixtures are NOT live website placement QA. The initial 651-title/100-modal comparison found no exact destination and made zero existing assignment changes. Later Man Camp group selection is a separate placement revision, so preparation-stage fingerprints must not be used to claim its acceptance. Its current evidence directory is audit/multifunctional-placement-2026-09-16/.
- Separate concurrent stateRentalOption helper extraction was preserved and its exact diff reviewed; all 651 generated H1 strings remained equal. No commit, push, publication, new page/photo section or indexing change in source preparation.

### 2026-09-16 — Laundry gallery identity and grouped-audit correction (LOCAL ONLY)

- Candidate: .temp/laundry-clarity-20260916/dist, http://127.0.0.1:4207. Base main HEAD 8ad98dba33ef6d9b7b1e64028da3fc639bd7fd9a; image changes uncommitted, no deployment. Exact source fingerprint and per-file hashes: audit/laundry-clarity-2026-09-16/summary.json.
- Confirmed all 50 cited laundry-unspecified records: 36 pages and seven states in two maps. Kept the same four source images, split as model-08 trailer (08.01) and model-06 container (06.01/02/03). Strengthened captions and full-image product identity; corrected inaccurate single-model report wording with explicit per-product imageGroups.
- Final TypeScript, formatter and JS syntax checks passed. 164 focused tests passed, including all 50 concrete flagged rows. An initial tuple-type issue in the new test prevented the first build; fixed explicit tuple typing and reran successfully. Initial/final evidence retained rather than claiming the first run passed.
- Application suite: 44/44 passed, one worker and 30-second timeout. Production compilation/prerender: 651 pages plus 404, draft/noindex; existing nonfatal build warnings remain.
- Chromium: 34/34 tests passed. All 50 targets at both 1440px and 390px produced 100 recorded presentations and 400 original-image checks. Tested product headings and reference captions, exact image alt/source, single-product navigation/wraparound, uncropped contain layout, close/keyboard/reset/stale-label behavior. Visually reviewed four desktop/mobile lightbox screenshots. Existing full/compact maps, carousel, layout-scope and calculator regression cases passed.
- Exhaustive local acceptance: 548 routes + 100 state-modal presentations, 648 PASS and 0 FAIL; no broken assigned images. H1, title, metadata, canonical, robots and sitemap checks passed. Coverage unchanged: 263 pictured pages, 247 deliberate no-image layouts, 38 actual placeholders and eight held states.
- Baseline comparison verified all image identity/status/order/source records unchanged apart from alt 08.01. Old port-4205 Service Areas HTML and served carousel JS remain byte-identical. The removed unsolicited hub, directory and generic category sections remain absent.
- Two concurrently edited non-image source files differ from the frozen candidate: directory intro spacing (CityDirectoryPage.tsx), and existing-city guide link labels (regionGuides.tsx). Exact diffs/hashes recorded, not overwritten; combined runtime validation of those edits is separate. All current image-lane files match this tested candidate. No live/CDN or Safari signoff claimed.
- Evidence: audit/laundry-clarity-2026-09-16/acceptance.json, acceptance.csv, laundry-50-rows.json, laundry-browser.json and summary.json. Logs: work/qa/laundry-clarity-20260916/. Old audit wording errata: audit/image-placement-revert-2026-09-16/LAUNDRY_AUDIT_ERRATA.md.

### 2026-09-16 — Services card photo corrections (local only)

- Visually inspected source assets and selected actual commercial dishwashing machine, shower-only stall, mobile laundry machines, and handwashing sink trailer photos for the four existing cards. No layout, copy, route or homepage-override changes.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed. `npx vitest run tests/servicesCardPhotos.test.tsx`: 2/2 passed for `/services/` and `/equipment-rental/`, including responsive sources, alt text and asset existence.
- Chromium at 390px: rendered the Services page with `Site` SSR markup against local Vite asset serving; all four card images selected their 480w source and decoded successfully. Direct Vite `/services/` navigation returned an empty root because this app expects generated prerender HTML; this check does not establish a complete production-page browser pass.
- No production build or live deployment in this task. Existing frozen review builds were not altered. Live Vercel imagery remains unverified until a coordinated release.

### 2026-09-16 — Revert unsolicited photo sections; preserve approved image updates

- Frozen local build: .temp/image-placement-revert-20260916/dist, http://127.0.0.1:4205. No Vercel deployment or live QA claimed.
- Runtime delta limited to Site.tsx, CityDirectoryPage.tsx and ApprovedEquipmentPhotoOptions.tsx. Site.tsx matches its task-start backup with ONLY the unused import and extra hub gallery removed. CityDirectoryPage.tsx matches base HEAD after line-ending normalization. Image manifest, policy, resolver, equipment image assignments and carousel/map controller fingerprints match the frozen build; no drift.
- Typecheck, production build (651 routes plus 404), 110 focused image/ordering/placement tests and 31 browser tests passed. All 246 directories received a static layout assertion; desktop/mobile map hero inspected visually. Browser suite opens all 100 state modal presentations, verifies state cleanup/lightboxes and retains April's specific inside-only container/all-five trailer/two-stall sleeper decisions.
- Application suite initially recorded 43 passes and one 15-second timeout in the existing source-archive consolidation test. No assertion or application code was changed. Full serial rerun with a 30-second timeout passed 44/44; that test completed in 5.7 seconds. Both logs retained.
- Fresh exhaustive route/modal audit: 648 PASS / 0 FAIL; 548 routes with 263 picture-bearing pages, 247 intentionally without a photo section, 38 photo placeholders; all 100 state-modal presentations included. No broken assigned paths. H1/title/meta/canonical/robots/sitemaps preserved against audit baseline. Intentionally absent navigation imagery is NOT a photography gap.
- Evidence: work/qa/image-placement-revert/{unit-tests.log,app-tests.log,app-tests-final.log,build.log,browser.log,route-audit.log,final-summary.log,map-hero-1440.png,map-hero-390.png}; audit/image-placement-revert-2026-09-16/{summary.json,acceptance.csv,acceptance.json}. Earlier 4201 and later ordering snapshots were not rebuilt by this task.

## 2026-09-16 — Exhaustive physical-view ordering follow-up

- Request: recheck every assigned carousel for interior-before-exterior; preserve photo identities, families, captions and held cases; create a new frozen build/handoff without commit, push or deployment.
- Visual findings: all 113 distinct assigned full-image paths inspected via ten fresh numbered contact sheets, with the two disputed originals also opened directly. model-21 21.04/21.08 show externally accessible sink banks; model-10 10.06 shows exterior doors/wheels/steps; 10.05 shows the actual shower/toilet interior despite an entry-steps filename. Their rendered order was already physically correct. One other existing handwashing hero was incorrectly labelled detail/Interior detail and now correctly says exterior. No image bytes, assignments, categories, captions or alt descriptions were changed.
- Source: shared pure ordering helper and renderer guard; resolver/service ordering consolidated; generated manifest v4 canonicalized per model and actual view with every prior image/model record preserved by ID. Added independent hash-pinned visual-view audit, permutation/direct-render unit checks and browser ordering checks.
- Frozen target: .temp/image-order-followup-20260916/dist; http://127.0.0.1:4203. Original 4201 output/old handoff retained; all 548 old Service Areas HTML hashes still match.
- Passed: TypeScript/build (651 pages plus 404, draft/noindex); 99 focused tests; 44 application tests; 32 Chromium browser tests; Prettier and git diff whitespace checks. The added browser sweep exercised all 100 state modal presentations and 28 distinct assigned sequences through complete-image lightboxes. Existing browser regression covers autoplay, reset/cleanup, keyboard/focus, mobile/desktop and reduced motion. An initial browser discovery run lacked the required Node JSON import attribute in the new test; that test-only import was fixed and the complete 32-test run passed. Runtime build/source remained unchanged during that test fix; both logs retained.
- Independent rendered-output/HTTP audit: all 651 registered routes fetched; 1,276 individual assigned carousels / 5,280 slide instances checked by physical-view evidence, not filename or imported resolver results. Service Areas subset: 548 pages + 100 modal presentations, 1,250 carousel groups, 5,169 slides. All passed. Zero effective sequence changes were necessary; one view label corrected. All 256 original/responsive asset responses matched old frozen bytes. Captions, selections, family/model identity, alt text, held fallbacks, H1/title/meta/canonical/robots/sitemaps remained unchanged. Existing service-area regression also passed 648/648 with no broken images.
- Coverage holds: 38 Service Areas pages / eight states unchanged; 108 approved and 46 withheld manifest use records unchanged. ADA/sleeper/refrigeration reference limitations remain. Native iOS/non-Chromium and live deployment not tested by this follow-up.
- Evidence: audit/image-order-followup-2026-09-16/HANDOFF.md, summary.json, assigned-slide-order.csv, all-assigned-gallery-order.csv, route-modal-inventory.csv, visual-view-review.json, browser-view-order-evidence.json, files-and-revision.json and service-area-regression-summary.json. Logs: work/qa/image-order-followup-20260916/.
- Revision: branch main; unchanged base HEAD 8ad98dba33ef6d9b7b1e64028da3fc639bd7fd9a; uncommitted ordering revision fingerprint f2270831321d02243f6778d4a27559f6a3b6d1d0f16d2fcd4ab07bd712d13c98. No commit, push, deployment, indexing change, inquiry submission or Vercel project creation.

## 2026-09-16 — Independent frozen-4201 image QA acceptance reported by coordinator

- Evidence source: the QA coordinator's latest direct message in this conversation. These are the coordinator's independent results, not a newly executed test run by the image implementation task.
- Reviewed target: `.temp/owner-image-rollout-20260916/dist`, served on port 4201; identity and inventories in `audit/image-update-qa-handoff-2026-09-16/HANDOFF.md`.
- Reported result: 648/648 Service Areas route/modal presentations matched the handoff inventory; 5,169 slide instances, interior-before-exterior ordering, captions/held fallbacks, 77 asset responses, and mobile/desktop samples checked; no definite wrong-family image mismatch. Do not equate slide instances with unique source photographs.
- Retained caveats: 38 modular-kitchen photo-held pages and the ADA, sleeper and refrigeration reference-evidence limits remain correctly labelled. This acceptance does not provide missing photos or validate previously unproven specifications.
- Status: image implementation and scoped independent frozen-build QA complete. Deployment and independent live QA remain separate pending stages; no new Vercel release is performed by this acknowledgment.
- Read-only confirmation at acknowledgment: branch `main`, base HEAD `8ad98dba33ef6d9b7b1e64028da3fc639bd7fd9a`; image changes remain uncommitted. Both root and snapshot manifest SHA-256 match `b2dd5c5c6b5bd2d6194421d9d583a8bdddeac914a512d80eda8dc72331fdcd57`; both policy hashes match `a6d254484922a68e1f1974a6d2f6952e84091625fc07005f7e143efd8ef070ad`. These match the handoff.
- Release boundary: preserve the accepted frozen build and original handoff. A later coordinated release must use the EXISTING temp123-nine Vercel project (no new project), record its source revision, immutable deployment URL and deployment ID, verify the alias points to that revision, and hand that exact URL to the independent reviewer for live QA. A passing build or an HTTP 200 alone is not live acceptance.

## 2026-09-16 — Owner-delegated available-photo rollout

- Scope: all 548 Service Areas routes, full and compact map presentations for all 50 states, named service/category reference additions and shared multi-gallery controls. Exact April refrigeration and two-stall rules preserved.
- Isolated compiled snapshot: .temp/owner-image-rollout-20260916; local HTTP http://127.0.0.1:4201. Other in-use dist folders were not rebuilt.
- Passed: TypeScript; 94 image/policy/component tests; 44 app tests (15-second timeout, two workers); production compilation/prerender for 651 pages plus 404; 29 Chromium browser tests; all 648 route/modal audit records at 08:48 UTC. No assigned broken image paths; H1/title/meta/canonical/robots/sitemap comparisons unchanged.
- Browser scope: 100 opened state presentations, every assigned modal image decoded, separate labelled equipment groups, state switching/reset/cleanup, unique carousel IDs with page and dialog open, complete-image lightbox, desktop/mobile layout, keyboard/focus, reduced motion, April refrigeration and calculator regressions. Visual screenshots reviewed at 1440px and390px.
- Coverage: 510 pages show suitable photos or disclosed references; 38 modular-kitchen pages still use the truthful placeholder. 42 of50 states have images; eight remain pending. Generic catalogue references do not establish exact physical/ADA specifications.
- Prettier and git diff whitespace checks passed. Existing non-fatal JSON import and vendor Rollup annotation warnings remain. No dedicated lint script is configured.
- Evidence: work/qa/owner-image-rollout/ command logs and screenshots; audit/owner-image-rollout-2026-09-16.csv, .json and -summary.json. Earlier historical results are retained separately. An initial report-copy helper used the wrong output basename; the audit itself passed and its actual output was preserved under the new report name.
- Publication: no commit/deployment/indexing/inquiry action by this task; independently validated local compilation only. Coordinator must validate the exact combined revision and live output before publication claims.

Record meaningful verification here. Do not record a check as passed unless it was actually run.

### 2026-09-16 — Independent CEO-level Service Areas image and SEO audit

- Scope: Read-only website/source audit; separate new audit artifacts, no implementation or deployment changes.
- Environments: Fresh isolated current-source production build; live public Vercel preview at temp123-nine.vercel.app; six canonical-domain paths probed separately.
- Evidence: 548 generated Service Areas routes reconciled with the registry and checked live (548 HTTP 200). Every actual image src, original lightbox path, responsive srcset, label, source hash, family and single-model association was independently checked rather than simply accepting the resolver output.
- Observed matching: 150 pages have correct photo sets. Another 73 have a safe pending state for missing ADA/modular-kitchen photography; 325 have a safe pending state requiring a title/image-policy decision. Placeholder safety is not photography completion.
- Browser: All 50 states in full Service Areas and compact mobile homepage maps (100 presentations) opened, navigated and cleared correctly. All assigned modal slides decoded. Twenty-two representative page visits at 1440/390px passed. State switching/reset, native uncropped lightbox layering/keyboard/focus/close, real 5.5-second autoplay, interaction pause and reduced motion passed. Zero recorded page exceptions, failed same-origin image requests or unexpected contact submissions.
- Assets/tests: 17 distinct displayed source photos visually rechecked; 51 live original/derivative files matched local bytes; 153 manifest source/catalog hashes rechecked. Seventy-four focused image/component tests and a fresh 651-page-plus-404 production build passed.
- SEO/release: All 548 preview routes remain noindex with no canonicals. The Vercel preview now contains the corrected imagery, but this audit did not deploy it or establish deployment identity. Canonical /service-areas/, Port Angeles and Tacoma returned 404; sampled Alabama/California/Texas paths returned 301. Regional production og:image generation still references legacy region.image and needs release review. No indexing results, traffic uplift, authority metrics or Core Web Vitals measurements claimed.
- Remaining content concerns: 40 shower-heading pages use a reviewed 20ft/five-stall reference set alongside supporting references to the 22ft/ten-stall option; explicit model context should be clarified. Thirty-nine sleeper pages have one matching exterior but no verified corresponding interior. No non-Chromium/native-iOS coverage.
- Artifacts: docs/phase1/SERVICE_AREA_CEO_AUDIT_2026-09-16.md; audit/service-area-ceo-audit-2026-09-16.csv (1,296 local/live records); audit/service-area-ceo-photo-needs-2026-09-16.csv; audit/service-area-ceo-audit-2026-09-16-summary.json; audit/service-area-ceo-browser-2026-09-16.json; work/qa/service-area-ceo-audit-20260916/.

### 2026-09-16 — Exhaustive Service Areas image and carousel acceptance

- Owner/task: Charles urgent Service Areas image task.
- Environment: Current local project, initial clean main baseline 923d3f477f71c2229c5f65089f1872dad59a0396. Production compilation/prerender was isolated in .temp/sa-image-validation because the shared root had concurrent contact/SEO work. Exact preview tested: http://127.0.0.1:4197. No deployment, commit, push, domain change or Search Console action by this task.
- Scope: All 548 dedicated service-area routes; all 50 state modals in both the full service-area map and compact homepage map (100 presentations); shared carousel and full-image lightbox; representative desktop/mobile pages; calculator and existing service-carousel regressions.
- Image review: Visually examined all 149 equipment-drive images and 4 existing catalog references. The pinned manifest contains 153 classifications, with 97 approved and 56 withheld. Generated 194 responsive WebP variants totaling 21,179,990 bytes. All 153 original source hashes were checked. Model ambiguity, exact/near duplicates, unsupported backgrounds and wrong form factors are recorded, not inferred away.
- Commands/checks: npm run typecheck; scoped npx prettier --check; node --check public/service-hero-carousel.js; npm test -- --testTimeout=15000 --maxWorkers=2; npx vitest run tests/locationCarouselImages.test.ts tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts --maxWorkers=2; npm run build in the isolated snapshot; Playwright service-area-images.spec.ts, service-hero-carousel.spec.ts and calculator.spec.ts with one worker and the explicit preview URL; node --import tsx scripts/audit-service-area-images.ts with the exact build/URL; npm run check:secrets; git diff --check.
- Observed results: TypeScript, formatting, JS syntax and whitespace checks passed. All 44 application tests and 74 image/carousel unit tests passed. Production compilation/prerender generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. All 23 Chromium browser tests passed, including every state in both map contexts, state switching and reset, complete-image desktop/mobile lightboxes above the expanded map/state dialogs, Tab/Escape/Arrow/Home/End, outside close, thumbnails, swipe versus vertical gestures, autoplay/manual pause and reduced motion. No page exceptions, console errors, failed same-origin assets or unexpected inquiry POSTs were recorded in the Service Areas acceptance browser evidence.
- Exhaustive audit: 648/648 rows PASS: 548 served page URLs plus 100 state-modal presentations. Every service-area route returned HTTP 200; assigned original/derivative paths had no failures. The independent generated-file/registry reconciliation, exact title/family/model mapping, source-hash uniqueness, interior-before-exterior order, unchanged H1/title/head metadata/canonical, route universe, robots and official/review sitemap checks passed. Browser evidence is bound to the audited HTML/controller/manifest fingerprint. A PASS may be the required truthful no-photo state; it is not evidence that missing photographs exist.
- Result counts: 301 former pooled page mappings corrected. Fifty fixed mixed state galleries replaced, with the same title-driven selection added to the compact map. 150 pages show matching photography; 398 pages and 27 states intentionally show the requested pending state. Missing-page breakdown: 289 unspecified/generic titles, 36 laundry titles without trailer/container distinction, 38 modular-kitchen titles without matching modular imagery, 35 ADA-combination titles without verified ADA assets.
- Defects found and corrected during this task: An initial native-lightbox Tab sequence could leave the dialog, so bounded Tab/Shift+Tab navigation was added and retested. Legacy absolute-position caption styling intercepted mobile thumbnail taps; the gallery caption now has a scoped static layout and taps pass. The static audit was corrected to parse inert template content as a fragment rather than misreporting it as absent. These were not waived.
- Test maintenance: The state editorial-length assertion now excludes gallery controls/pending UI while retaining its original 250–500-word editorial limit; no page copy was changed for the test. The archived-source fingerprint test exceeded its original five-second default under load, so the full application suite was rerun unchanged with a recorded 15-second timeout and two workers. The isolated snapshot was moved under excluded .temp so normal test discovery does not execute stale duplicate tests from a work folder. Existing carousel assertions were adapted to native-dialog focus and the requirement that Play resumes after interaction ends, not while still focused/hovered.
- Security check: The existing pattern scanner checked 2,104 source/built-text files with no findings. This is not a cloud IAM or full credential audit; credential files were not opened for this task. Existing JSON import-consistency, third-party Zod annotation and terminal color-environment warnings remain non-fatal and are not claimed fixed.
- Pass/fail: PASS for this local image workstream and its measured acceptance boundary. The shared project release gate remains separate; do not mark live production complete from these local results.
- Remaining unverified boundary: Production/Vercel/CDN output after deployment; native mobile browsers and engines other than the exercised Chromium build; missing or ambiguous photography/configuration evidence; unrelated active workstreams and provider/intake/indexing integrations. No live deployment URL or post-deployment test is claimed.
- Artifacts: audit/service-area-images-2026-09-16.csv, the paired JSON and summary JSON, audit/service-area-image-classification.csv, content/verified-equipment-images.json, audit/service-area-image-source-inventory.json, audit/service-area-images-baseline-2026-09-16.json.gz, docs/phase1/SERVICE_AREA_IMAGE_AUDIT.md, and command/browser/screenshot evidence under work/qa/service-area-images/.

### 2026-09-16 — Owner-visible SEO dashboard MVP

- Owner/task: Urgent Temporary123 workstream — owner-visible SEO dashboard
- Environment and URL: Local production build and static preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/seo-dashboard/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Display the imported Top 25 authority URLs as protected exact targets; distinguish exact slug, HTTP/redirect, canonical, sitemap, content restoration, proposed-title approval, testing, internal-link, Google verification/indexing/submission, portfolio readiness, and domain-authority evidence without inventing third-party results
- Commands/checks performed: `npx vitest run tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`; `npm run typecheck`; `npm test`; `npm run build`; isolated final `npx vite build --outDir dist-seo-dashboard-validation --emptyOutDir`; local HTTP request to the prerendered dashboard; headless Chromium at 1440 x 900 and 390 x 900
- Observed result: Four dashboard tests and all 44 existing application tests passed. TypeScript passed. The full Vite/prerender build generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. The dashboard returned HTTP 200 and contained the prerendered dashboard heading and authority register. Chromium rendered 25 protected-URL rows and 25 Google-status rows at both viewports, preserved the unauthenticated-access warning, and measured no page-level horizontal overflow. After the final display-only 651-page counter was added, its SSR test and isolated client build passed; a repeat build to `dist` could not empty a directory held by the already-running shared preview server (`ENOTEMPTY`), so that process was not terminated. The isolated build output was removed after validation.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the local read-only dashboard MVP and its evidence-labeling boundary
- Remaining unverified boundary: The route is not authenticated and must not hold confidential exports or credentials. Search Console property access, URL Inspection/index status, submission history, Moz/Ahrefs live checks or APIs, approved new titles, internal-link crawl results, historical-content comparisons, additional portfolio domains, production-domain behavior, and owner acceptance remain unconnected or unknown. The builds retained existing JSON import-consistency and third-party Zod annotation warnings. No deployment was performed.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/SeoDashboard.tsx`; `src/authorityTop25.ts`; `src/seo-dashboard.css`; `tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`; `audit/phase1-top-25-authority-urls.csv`; `audit/all-pages-sitemap-summary.json`

No earlier test result is being reconstructed as confirmed by this coordination setup. Existing reports under `docs/` and `audit/` should be reviewed and linked here by their responsible task.

### 2026-09-15 — Rental calculator location-field refinement

- Owner/task: Temporary Kitchen 123 — calculator refinement
- Environment and URL: Local production build; `/` and `/rental-calculator/`
- Change or requirement tested: Separate state, city, and ZIP inputs; published equipment and delivery calculations; stable calculator H1; readable city/state HTML; mobile-width overflow
- Commands/checks performed: `npm test`; `npm run build`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/calculator.spec.ts`; direct `cityPages` data count
- Observed result: 41 automated tests passed; TypeScript/Vite build and static generation for 650 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 completed; 3 calculator browser tests passed; the source data contains 19,702 cities across all 50 states; the 390-by-844 calculator route had no horizontal overflow; an invalid four-digit ZIP failed browser validity and a five-digit ZIP passed
- Pass/fail: Pass for the assigned location-field refinement and tested calculator behavior
- Remaining unverified boundary: This task did not deploy. The current form calculates locally and does not submit or store a quote request, so the combined `Get Starting Estimate / Request Quote` behavior is not fully implemented. Build warnings about inconsistent JSON import attributes and third-party Zod comment annotations remain outside this assignment.
- Evidence or artifact: `tests/calculator.test.ts`; `tests/browser/calculator.spec.ts`; generated `dist/rental-calculator/index.html`

### 2026-09-15 — Mobile Dishwashing Trailer WordPress 404 audit

- Owner/task: WordPress 442 URL repair
- Environment and URL: External production site, `https://mobile-dishwashing-trailer-facility-rental.com/`; read-only public proxy where direct origin access was unavailable
- Change or requirement tested: Reproduce reported 404s, inventory published sitemap URLs, verify representative live/404 behavior, and establish backup/admin prerequisites before repair
- Commands/checks performed: Public homepage/robots/sitemap retrieval; parsed `page-sitemap1.xml` through `page-sitemap11.xml` and `resources-sitemap.xml`; sampled first/middle/last URL per sitemap; tested a deliberately nonexistent URL; DNS resolution; TCP 80/443 checks; in-app browser request to WordPress admin
- Observed result: 31,159 unique listed URLs. Of 36 representative URLs, 21 returned live page content, 15 were proxy-throttled with 429, and 0 of the successful fetches returned 404. A deliberately nonexistent URL returned the site's 404 response. Direct origin/admin connections timed out.
- Pass/fail: Blocked; public audit evidence collected, but the reported 442 URLs were not available and production prerequisites were unmet
- Remaining unverified boundary: Exact affected URLs and categories; WordPress settings/themes/plugins/logs; restorable files-and-database backup; repair; exact-set post-fix recrawl
- Evidence or artifact: `docs/wordpress-404-audit-2026-09-15.md`

### 2026-09-15 — Calculator-only action and optional exact-quote release

- Owner/task: Temporary Kitchen 123 — calculator quote submission
- Environment and URL: Local production build and live production at `https://temp123-nine.vercel.app/` and `/rental-calculator/`; current deployment `dpl_J7uvvuU7BA8LLTQWoNW2d1gvGWzS`
- Change or requirement tested: Separate calculator-only and exact-quote actions; required contact consent; deterministic equipment/delivery result; separate state, city and optional ZIP; static city HTML; mobile overflow; production intake readiness
- Commands/checks performed: `npm test`; `npm run build`; local and live `npx playwright test tests/browser/calculator.spec.ts`; one headless live calculation with network-request counting; one clearly labeled fictional QA quote attempt; one valid-shaped direct API boundary probe; temporary `CONTACT_ENABLED=true` deployment followed by safe rollback and redeployment
- Observed result: 44 automated tests passed. TypeScript/Vite build and static generation for 650 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 completed. All 4 calculator browser tests passed both locally and on the current production alias. The live Port Angeles mobile-kitchen example produced `$6,490`, displayed that no contact information was sent, and made zero `/api/contact` requests. The fictional exact-quote attempt stopped before an API request because the deployed client lacks usable Firebase/App Check configuration; a direct valid-shaped API probe returned HTTP 503. No inquiry was saved or emailed. `CONTACT_ENABLED` was restored to `false`, and the production UI now visibly disables the exact-quote action while keeping the calculator available.
- Pass/fail: Pass for calculator-only behavior and deployed UI split; blocked for live exact-quote intake
- Remaining unverified boundary: Valid production Firebase web/App Check values, server database credentials and IAM, approved Resend sender/recipient, actual persistence, inbox delivery, retry scheduler, and operator recovery remain unverified. Existing build warnings about inconsistent JSON import attributes and third-party Zod annotations are outside this assignment.
- Evidence or artifact: `tests/calculator.test.ts`; `tests/browser/calculator.spec.ts`; Vercel deployment `dpl_J7uvvuU7BA8LLTQWoNW2d1gvGWzS`

### 2026-09-15 — Phase 1 content and H1 audit

- Owner/task: Temporary123 Phase 1 — CONTENT + H1
- Environment and URL: Current local `dist` snapshot and live candidate `https://temp123-nine.vercel.app/`
- Change or requirement tested: Inventory all current rendered page families; verify H1 counts; compare representative live/local H1s; prepare multi-family content and H1 proposals without implementation
- Commands/checks performed: Parsed all local `dist/**/index.html` files with Cheerio; classified page families; counted state/region heading-pattern distribution; fetched and parsed 16 representative live routes; inspected source data for the 22 ft shower configuration; parsed the new CSV with PowerShell `Import-Csv`; ran scoped whitespace/diff validation
- Observed result: 650 local rendered pages were inventoried; all 650 have exactly one H1. All 16 representative live routes returned HTTP 200 with exactly one H1 and matched local H1 text. Four weak generated patterns affect 23 of 50 state pages and 119 of 246 region pages. The proposal CSV contains 49 data rows and all required mapping fields.
- Pass/fail: Pass for audit completeness and artifact integrity; implementation remains pending owner decisions
- Remaining unverified boundary: No content/H1/source change was implemented. The owner must confirm homepage handling, generated-location assignments, the 22 ft unit’s flagship/three-sink specification, dishmachine brands, institutional/procurement claims, protected URLs, and city operational briefs. Live browser visual rendering beyond source-HTML H1 verification was not part of this audit.
- Evidence or artifact: `docs/phase1/CONTENT_H1_AUDIT.md`; `audit/phase1-content-h1-mapping.csv`

### 2026-09-15 — Exact-service carousel integration

- Owner/task: Temporary123 image/carousel — IMPLEMENTATION
- Environment and URL: Local production build served at `http://localhost:4173/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Exact inventory mapping; responsive derivative generation; deterministic interior, exterior, then remaining order; server-rendered first image; deferred later images; native controls; arrow/Home/End keys; horizontal swipe; vertical-gesture preservation; inactive-alt suppression; truthful unverified-route fallback; and removal of mislabeled homepage Shower/Restroom imagery
- Commands/checks performed: `python scripts/build-service-hero-assets.py`; `npm run build`; `npx vitest run tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts --reporter=line`; a Chromium smoke loop through all ten mapped routes that decoded the first image, activated/decoded the second image, and checked image counts; scoped Prettier; `git diff --check`; Chromium screenshots and element-level visual inspection at 1440×1000 and 390×844
- Observed result: Ten exact routes use 54 approved inventory images and 108 generated 480/960 WebP derivatives totaling 9.71 MiB. Static generation completed for 650 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Five focused unit/server-render tests and six Chromium tests passed. All ten route-smoke checks rendered one carousel and successfully loaded the first and activated second images. Tests observed interior-first/exterior-second order where an exterior exists, control and keyboard navigation, swipe behavior, viewport containment at both widths, non-photo fallback on an unverified model, and zero images in the two corrected homepage cards. Desktop/mobile screenshots showed the carousel and controls within the layout; portrait equipment photography is intentionally contained rather than cropped.
- Pass/fail: Pass for local implementation and focused actual-route QA
- Remaining unverified boundary: Production behavior is unchanged because deployment was prohibited. Exact imagery remains unavailable or unsafe for 26 ft bulk kitchen; exact 22/24/26 ft dishwashing variants; unresolved 38 ft dishwashing identity; 30 ft laundry; 12 ft and 40 ft refrigeration; 22 ft shower-only; 20 ft restroom-only; 30 ft combination; ADA combinations; sleeper trailers; and 24 ft laundry. The 13 ft combination route has only two approved interiors, and the 28 ft kitchen route has no approved exterior. The build retains pre-existing JSON-import consistency and third-party Zod annotation warnings.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/ServiceHeroCarousel.tsx`; `src/serviceHeroImages.ts`; `src/service-hero-carousel.css`; `public/service-hero-carousel.js`; `public/images/service-heroes/`; `scripts/build-service-hero-assets.py`; `src/ServiceDetail.tsx`; `src/Equipment.tsx`; `src/homepage.css`; `tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx`; `tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts`; `tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts`; `work/qa/service-carousel/`; `docs/phase1/DRIVE_ASSET_INVENTORY.md`

### 2026-09-15 — Google Drive equipment-image inventory and classification

- Owner/task: Temporary123 image/carousel — ASSET INVENTORY AND CLASSIFICATION
- Environment and URL: Read-only inspection of the 20 supplied Google Drive references; local inventory artifact only
- Change or requirement tested: Enumerate every accessible image; classify interior, exterior, detail, diagram, duplicate, or unusable; record orientation and exact Drive file identity; select deterministic best-interior and best-exterior positions; identify asset and route-model gaps
- Commands/checks performed: Enumerated every supplied folder through the Google Drive connector; followed the nested actual 20ft Laundry Container folder; downloaded accessible images for contact-sheet review; extracted image dimensions, orientation, SHA-256 hashes, and Drive metadata; visually inspected all contact sheets; validated the finished Markdown for 20 detailed folder sections and 115 detailed image rows
- Observed result: 133 direct items were found: 112 direct images, 20 child equipment folders inside the incorrectly supplied laundry parent, and one `.DS_Store`. The nested actual laundry folder added 3 images, for 115 visually inspected images total. Every image was accessible after retry. Seven groups contain both interior and exterior views. Two exact duplicate pairs, one refrigerated near-duplicate, ambiguous laundry model identity, missing views, non-commercial backgrounds, and current service rows without exact folders are documented.
- Pass/fail: Pass for inventory completeness and classification artifact integrity; not approval to implement every supplied image
- Remaining unverified boundary: The owner must confirm ambiguous model identity, the shared 22–26ft dish mapping, and the correct 38ft conveyor set; replacement commercial-setting and missing-view images are still needed. No route integration, source edit, commit, publish, or deployment was performed.
- Evidence or artifact: `docs/phase1/DRIVE_ASSET_INVENTORY.md`

### 2026-09-15 — Full page inventory and live sitemap reconciliation

- Owner/task: Temporary Kitchen 123 — ALL PAGES + SITEMAP
- Environment and URL: Local generated `dist` inventory and live preview `https://temp123-nine.vercel.app/`
- Change or requirement tested: Enumerate every registered page; reconcile generated HTML, live HTTP behavior, robots directives, canonicals, and membership in the live `sitemap.xml`
- Commands/checks performed: Parsed `audit/build-registry.json`; checked the corresponding local HTML file for every route; fetched all 650 live preview URLs; parsed each response's robots meta and canonical; fetched and parsed the live sitemap and robots file; validated the resulting CSV for row and URL uniqueness
- Observed result: 650 unique registered routes and 650 corresponding local HTML files. All 650 live URLs returned HTTP 200, with 0 redirects and 0 request errors. Every live page carried `noindex,follow`, 0 pages exposed a canonical, and the valid live sitemap contained 0 URLs. The registry also reported 0 routes indexable in the current preview build.
- Pass/fail: Pass for complete route enumeration and current preview reconciliation. The preview sitemap is intentionally empty and must not list noindex Vercel URLs.
- Remaining unverified boundary: Canonical-domain routing, first-batch production activation, index/follow output, self-referencing `temporary123.com` canonicals, production sitemap membership, Search Console submission, and Google indexation were not enabled or verified. Content approval of all 650 pages is not implied.
- Evidence or artifact: `docs/phase1/ALL_PAGES_SITEMAP_AUDIT.md`; `audit/all-pages-sitemap.csv`; `audit/all-pages-sitemap-summary.json`

### 2026-09-16 — Owner-approved homepage Shower Trailer image

- Owner/task: Temporary123 — approved Shower Trailer homepage image
- Environment and URL: Local component/render harness using the current source and static preview assets at `http://localhost:4173/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Replace the incorrect shower/restroom-combination homepage Shower thumbnail with Charles's explicitly identified Shower Trailer image; preserve responsive delivery and truthful labeling without asserting an exact model
- Commands/checks performed: Generated 480 x 640 and 960 x 1280 WebP derivatives with FFmpeg; ran `npm run build`; ran the focused Playwright homepage assertion; rendered the actual `Cards` component server-side and exercised it in Chromium at 1440 x 1000 and 390 x 844; checked decoded image dimensions, `src`, `srcset`, alt text, `object-fit`, and document overflow
- Observed result: TypeScript and Vite client build passed. The actual component emitted `/images/catalog/shower-trailer-960.webp` with its 480/960 responsive source set and the category-specific alt text. Chromium decoded the image at both viewports, rendered it with `object-fit: cover`, and measured zero horizontal overflow on mobile.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the affected component, responsive image delivery, and browser rendering. The full production build and normal page-level Playwright route could not complete because the active prerender workstream imports `audit/phase1-top-25-authority-urls.csv` as an unsupported module (`ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`); the static preview therefore had an empty SSR root.
- Remaining unverified boundary: The complete prerendered homepage and live Vercel deployment were not verified or changed. The supplied image establishes the Shower Trailer category only, not an exact length, stall count, or route-level model. Restroom imagery was not changed by this task.
- Evidence or artifact: `public/images/catalog/shower-trailer-480.webp`; `public/images/catalog/shower-trailer-960.webp`; `src/Equipment.tsx`; `tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts`

### 2026-09-16 — Full Temporary123 review sitemap export

- Owner/task: Temporary Kitchen 123 — sitemap review export
- Environment and URL: Local repository artifact for the future canonical origin `https://temporary123.com`; no deployment or Search Console submission
- Change or requirement tested: Generate a complete owner/dev review sitemap without weakening the preview noindex gate or changing the official controlled production sitemap
- Commands/checks performed: Generated `public/sitemap-review.xml` from all paths in `audit/build-registry.json`; parsed the XML with PowerShell's XML parser; counted URL and unique URL nodes; validated every hostname
- Observed result: Valid XML containing 650 URL entries, 650 unique URLs, and 0 non-`temporary123.com` hosts. First URL is `https://temporary123.com/`; final sorted URL is `https://temporary123.com/video/`. File size is 58,569 bytes; SHA-256 is `945B1DAAA65AF4BAE7912D1CBCB87B9C9B904E413C3BDF6F6B4A2F37E37D0CFF`.
- Pass/fail: Pass for complete review export and XML integrity
- Remaining unverified boundary: The review export does not approve all pages for indexing and was not deployed, linked from robots.txt, submitted to Search Console, or checked against the future production host. The official `sitemap.xml` remains gated until the canonical domain and first approved indexing batch are ready.
- Evidence or artifact: `public/sitemap-review.xml`; `scripts/generate-review-sitemap.mjs`

### 2026-09-16 — Port Angeles shower-trailer individual-room wording

- Owner/task: Current task — Port Angeles individual-room wording
- Environment and URL: Local source and server-rendered `CityDetail` component for `/service-areas/washington/olympic-peninsula/port-angeles/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Append `with individual rooms` to the linked text `22 ft shower trailer rentals, 10 stalls` on Port Angeles only, without changing its destination, H1, or the shared wording on other city pages
- Commands/checks performed: Ran `npm run typecheck`; ran `npx vite build`; rendered Port Angeles and Sequim through `CityDetail` with `react-dom/server`; checked the exact Port Angeles phrase, absence of that phrase on Sequim, and the unchanged Port Angeles H1; ran `git diff --check`
- Observed result: TypeScript and the Vite production client build passed. The server-rendered Port Angeles page contains exactly `22 ft shower trailer rentals, 10 stalls with individual rooms`; Sequim retains the shared label without the suffix; Port Angeles retains one `Kitchen Trailer Rental in Port Angeles, Washington` H1. `git diff --check` reported only pre-existing line-ending warnings and no whitespace errors.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the requested local behavior and regression boundaries
- Remaining unverified boundary: The Vite development shell cannot provide a page-level browser render because this app expects prerendered HTML, and the full prerender remains blocked by the separately owned CSV-module import error already recorded above. The live Vercel page was not changed or post-deployment tested.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/CityDetail.tsx`

### 2026-09-16 — Boss-approved Temporary123 H1 plan

- Owner/task: Current task — Boss H1 implementation
- Environment and URL: Local production build and static preview at `http://localhost:4173/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Apply the approved non-home H1 formula using a source-supported service/facility topic plus rental intent and location where applicable; keep one H1 per page, align the document title, rotate deterministically, and preserve held or unsupported subjects
- Commands/checks performed: `npm run build`; `npm test`; `npm run check:headlines`; `npx vitest run tests/h1-plan.test.ts`; focused Playwright runs for `tests/browser/location-refresh.spec.ts` and `tests/browser/site.spec.ts`; direct inspection of generated homepage, service-area, state, city, and exact-model HTML; `git diff --check`
- Observed result: TypeScript, Vite, and prerender completed for 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. All 44 existing automated tests passed. The headline audit checked 548 location pages with 548 unique H1s and zero issues. Four focused unit tests passed. Seven responsive location/industry/planner Chromium tests plus the exact-model H1/title Chromium test passed. Representative generated pages each had exactly one H1 and an aligned title, including California, Texas, Port Angeles, and the 22 ft 6-stall combination trailer. The homepage H1 remained `Temporary Facilities and Trailer Rental / Rent or Lease Nationwide`.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the approved local H1 implementation and affected runtime behavior
- Remaining unverified boundary: No commit or Vercel deployment was performed. Live `temp123-nine.vercel.app` output, future `temporary123.com` production metadata, canonical/indexing activation, and Search Console behavior were not changed or verified. Seattle and Sequim editorial H1s, unsupported brand/specification claims, dishwashing, and refrigeration wording remain held or unchanged by design.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/rentalHeadlines.ts`; `src/StateDetail.tsx`; `src/CityDetail.tsx`; `src/Site.tsx`; `scripts/prerender.tsx`; `scripts/check-location-headlines.mjs`; `tests/h1-plan.test.ts`; focused browser tests

### 2026-09-16 — Service-area state modal H1-rule wording

- Owner/task: Current task — state modal H1-rule wording
- Environment and URL: Local production build and static preview at `http://localhost:4173/service-areas/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Reuse each dedicated state page's approved H1 wording in the corresponding map modal without introducing a second page-level H1 or removing the dedicated state-guide route
- Commands/checks performed: `npm run build`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/state-services.spec.ts tests/browser/location-refresh.spec.ts --reporter=line`; focused rerun of `tests/browser/state-services.spec.ts`; scoped Prettier and `git diff --check`
- Observed result: TypeScript, Vite, and prerender completed for 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. All 8 focused Chromium tests passed across desktop and mobile; the focused state suite passed again after adding the semantic regression assertion. California, New Hampshire, and Texas modal names matched `stateRentalHeadline(...)`; the modal title remained an `h2`, `/service-areas/` retained one `h1`, and state-guide links continued to point to dedicated state routes.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the requested local modal behavior and regression boundaries
- Remaining unverified boundary: No Vercel deployment was requested or performed, so `https://temp123-nine.vercel.app/service-areas/` remains unchanged and was not post-deployment tested. The pre-existing formatting warning in `src/main.tsx`, JSON import warning, and third-party Zod annotation warnings remain outside this task.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/CoverageMap.tsx`; `src/StateGuideCards.tsx`; state-headline binding in `src/main.tsx`; `tests/browser/state-services.spec.ts`; `tests/browser/location-refresh.spec.ts`

### 2026-09-16 — Cross-workstream acceptance QA handoff

- Owner/task: Task `01a08152-5280-7802-83d5-35eb5844c05c` — QA gate
- Environment and URL: Shared local worktree and static preview at `http://localhost:4173/`; read-only QA, no deployment and no real inquiry submission
- Change or requirement tested: Baseline acceptance coverage for H1 generation, city inventory, internal links, build/type/prerender, indexing artifacts, dashboard evidence fields, service imagery/carousel behavior, responsive layouts, and calculate-only contact isolation
- Commands/checks performed: `npm run build`; `npm test`; focused Vitest for H1/carousel/image-order tests; `npm run check:headlines`; `npm run check:cities`; `npm run check:links`; focused Chromium calculator and service-carousel suites; attempted broader location/state browser suites
- Observed result: Build/type/prerender passed and generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Headline audit passed 548/548 unique location H1s with zero issues; city and internal-link checks passed. Calculator and carousel Chromium checks passed 14/14, including no contact request from calculate-only, disabled exact-quote behavior, reduced-motion/keyboard/swipe behavior, mobile containment, and full-width hero presentation. The base test suite had 43 passes and one default-timeout failure in `tests/migration.test.ts`; that file passed 8/8 when rerun with a 15-second timeout (the affected test took 3.47 seconds). Focused image-order unit coverage found a genuine mismatch: expected `inside`, `outside`, `detail`, received `inside`, `detail`, `outside`. The dashboard imports a 650-route audit snapshot while the current build has 651 routes after adding `/seo-dashboard/`, so its route totals are stale. Broader browser runs were invalidated when another active build removed `dist/404.html`, crashing the preview server and producing connection-refused cascades. One pre-crash assertion also rejects valid approved `For Rent` wording because its regex accepts only `Rental|Lease|Facilities`.
- Pass/fail: Review needed. Core build, H1 audit, city/link audits, calculator isolation, and focused carousel interactions passed. Final gate must remain open for semantic image order, refreshed dashboard inventory, acceptance-test wording, and a single uncontended browser run.
- Remaining unverified boundary: Per lead instruction, no further builds or browser servers were launched while the carousel lane remained active. The boss task will run the clean final acceptance gate after active implementation lanes complete. Live Vercel output, production canonicals/indexability, Search Console, and downstream contact delivery were not changed or tested.
- Evidence or artifact: `tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts`; `audit/all-pages-sitemap-summary.json`; `src/SeoDashboard.tsx`; Playwright error evidence under `test-results/`

### 2026-09-16 — Accessible carousel and commercial-image presentation refinement

- Owner/task: Urgent Temporary123 imagery/presentation refinement
- Environment and URL: Shared local worktree and static preview at `http://localhost:4173/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Accessible auto-advance and persistent manual pause, reduced-motion behavior, interior/detail-before-exterior ordering, edge-to-edge hero media, approved homepage Shower imagery, truthful Restroom fallback, and visible-setting alt text
- Commands/checks performed: `npx vitest run tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts`; `npm run typecheck`; `npm run build`; `npx vite build --emptyOutDir false`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts`; direct visual inspection of the approved Shower, combination-unit, refrigerated-trailer, and warehouse-context assets
- Observed result: Six focused unit tests and TypeScript passed. The build reached client compilation and generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Nine final Chromium checks passed, including real-page autoplay, persistent manual pause, keyboard/swipe controls, reduced motion, deterministic semantic ordering, exact-model fallback, loaded images, mobile/desktop containment, and edge-to-edge media geometry. The homepage assertion had passed in the earlier focused 10/10 run; in the final shared run it could not execute because another build replaced the prerendered root with the empty Vite shell while the test was running. This shared-artifact race is not evidence of a homepage behavior regression.
- Pass/fail: Implementation and focused carousel/image tests pass; final combined acceptance remains with the boss task for one uncontended build/preview run
- Remaining unverified boundary: No verified restroom-only source image exists, so the Restroom card deliberately has no photo. Image-derived geographic locations are not claimed. The shared `dist` directory was concurrently replaced during final QA; live Vercel/CDN behavior was not changed or tested.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/ServiceHeroCarousel.tsx`; `src/serviceHeroImages.ts`; `src/service-hero-carousel.css`; `public/service-hero-carousel.js`; homepage mapping in `src/Equipment.tsx`; `tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx`; `tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts`; `tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts`
### 2026-09-16 — SEO dashboard indexing and authority priority order

- Owner/task: Current task — indexing and authority first
- Environment and URL: Isolated local client build and focused Chromium-rendered dashboard layout; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Put Google indexing status first and `Authority metrics by website` second above overview/supporting dashboard sections, and match the sidebar navigation order without changing any metrics or evidence states
- Commands/checks performed: `npx vitest run tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`; `npm run typecheck`; `npx vite build --outDir work/seo-order-dist`; `npx playwright test tests/browser/seo-dashboard-order.spec.ts --reporter=line`; scoped `git diff --check`
- Observed result: All 5 focused component tests passed; TypeScript passed; the isolated Vite client build passed; the Chromium layout check confirmed indexing renders above authority metrics and authority metrics renders above overview. Navigation lists Google status and Authority metrics first. Existing Google, DA, and evidence values were not changed.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the requested local dashboard ordering
- Remaining unverified boundary: No Vercel deployment was requested or performed, so the live preview dashboard was not changed or post-deployment tested. Search Console and independent authority-provider data remain unconnected as already disclosed by the dashboard.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/SeoDashboard.tsx`; `src/seo-dashboard.css`; `tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`; `tests/browser/seo-dashboard-order.spec.ts`

### 2026-09-16 — SEO dashboard live-refresh recovery

- Owner/task: Current task - live refresh defect
- Environment and URL: Live read-only diagnosis at `https://temp123-nine.vercel.app/seo-dashboard/`; local production build and static preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/seo-dashboard/`; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Repair the orange `Running live production and preview checks...` status and disabled `Refreshing...` button that never settled
- Commands/checks performed: Fetched the live dashboard HTML and `/api/seo-live`; ran `npx vitest run tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx tests/seo-live.test.ts`; ran `npm run typecheck`; ran an isolated Vite production client build; ran `npm run build`; exercised the actual local prerendered dashboard in Chromium with both the real failure response and a controlled successful `/api/seo-live` response, then clicked `Refresh now` again
- Observed result: The live dashboard returned HTTP 200 and contained the frozen running/disabled server state, while the live API independently returned HTTP 200 with 19,140 bytes. Source diagnosis confirmed the page was prerendered without React hydration. After the fix, the real local API failure produced `Live check failed... Showing stored evidence.` and re-enabled `Refresh now`; the successful response produced a `Live checked` timestamp, re-enabled the button, and a manual click issued a second request. No React hydration errors were observed. The full build generated 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404.
- Pass/fail: Pass locally for initial fallback, automatic live check, explicit failure recovery, successful completion, and manual retry
- Remaining unverified boundary: The live Vercel page remains unchanged because this task did not deploy. Post-deployment behavior and provider data beyond the current HTTP endpoint remain unverified.
- Evidence or artifact: `src/SeoDashboard.tsx`; dashboard-only hydration block in `src/main.tsx`; `tests/seo-dashboard.test.tsx`

### 2026-09-16 — Google Drive source-asset download and integrity check

- Owner/task: Current task - Drive asset gathering
- Environment and URL: Local worktree; 25 supplied Google Drive folder links; no deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Download the supplied Temporary123 equipment assets into one accessible project directory without changing existing website imagery or page code
- Commands/checks performed: Google Drive folder metadata and direct-child inventory; raw Drive file downloads; exact downloaded-size comparison against Drive metadata; PowerShell recursive folder/file/byte reconciliation; Pillow `Image.verify()` across every PNG/JPEG; SHA-256 generation
- Observed result: The links resolve to the `Equipments` parent plus 24 child folders. The parent also contains an omitted `20ft Laundry Container` child. The deduplicated local collection contains 25 equipment folders, 149 images, 149 manifest rows, and 323,702,572 image bytes. All downloads matched expected sizes; Pillow verified 149 images with zero corrupt files; 149 SHA-256 entries were generated.
- Pass/fail: Pass for download completeness, local organization, byte-size integrity, and image decoding
- Remaining unverified boundary: The imagery has not been approved for any particular route, model, setting claim, or alt text. No website runtime, Git commit, push, or deployment was changed or tested.
- Evidence or artifact: `work/drive-assets-2026-09-16/README.md`; `work/drive-assets-2026-09-16/manifest.csv`; `work/drive-assets-2026-09-16/SHA256SUMS.txt`

### 2026-09-16 — Sticky Project Desk and Emergency dispatch redesign

- Owner/task: Temporary123_BUILD — commercial dispatch redesign; independent QA by task `01a08152-5280-7802-83d5-35eb5844c05c`
- Environment and URL: Shared local worktree; immutable production-build copy served at `http://127.0.0.1:4173/`; no production deployment
- Change or requirement tested: Compact desktop Project Desk edge tab and maximum-400 px drawer; compact mobile safe-area controls; activity-gated Emergency expansion; 24-hour dismissal persistence; one visible Emergency control; Project Desk/Emergency mutual exclusion; truthful telephone and availability actions; keyboard, Escape, focus return, reduced motion, responsive containment, and preserved quote form
- Commands/checks performed: `npm run typecheck`; `npm run build`; focused Playwright sticky-control selection; full `npx playwright test tests/browser/site.spec.ts` against an immutable preview; independent QA rerun of 11 focused Chromium checks; `npm test`; scoped Prettier check
- Observed result: TypeScript and the full Vite/prerender build passed, generating 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404. Implementation and independent QA both passed the 15-second-after-activity timing, no-activity hold, 24-hour localStorage dismissal, manual reopening, exact `tel:+18004435212`, single-trigger state, mutual exclusion, keyboard activation, Escape/focus return, reduced-motion override, desktop/mobile drawers, and homepage widths 320, 390, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, and 1536. The automatic panel is a labelled non-modal dialog, did not move focus or open the Project Desk, and suppressed its compact trigger while expanded. Both compact mobile controls measured 180×52 px, exceeding the 44 px touch target. Computed color pairs range from 4.57:1 to 12.54:1 for the sticky system's text. Independent visual inspection found no clipping, overlap, hierarchy, or legibility blocker. Four representative routes retained one H1, one sticky-control system, no horizontal overflow, and no console/page errors. Preview `robots.txt` remained HTTP 200 with the intentional preview policy, and the preview sitemap remained HTTP 200 and empty. The full site file passed 31/33; its two failures are unrelated stale assertions for the concurrently added Calculator navigation item and the already approved `Shower Trailer` / `Shower & Restroom Combination Facilities` labels. The base unit command passed 87/88; the sole failure came from the unrelated duplicate `work/sa-image-validation` copy where Alabama content is 511 words against that copy's 500-word ceiling. The scoped Prettier check reports existing formatting drift in shared `src/main.tsx` and `tests/browser/site.spec.ts`; broad formatting was not applied because those files contain other active owners' work.
- Pass/fail: Pass for the scoped implementation and independent acceptance criteria; combined deployment gate remains pending
- Remaining unverified boundary: Live Vercel behavior is unchanged. Deployment is intentionally held while service-area image and H1 workstreams still own shared files; deploy only after one uncontended final build/browser gate, then verify timing, persistence, mutual exclusion, telephone action, drawer form, responsive layout, and console state on the live URL.
- Evidence or artifact: Contact/Emergency markup in `src/Site.tsx`; matching interaction block in `src/main.tsx`; `src/contact-refresh.css`; focused assertions in `tests/browser/site.spec.ts`; `test-results/sticky-contact-qa/report.json`; six homepage and six open-drawer screenshots under `test-results/sticky-contact-qa/`

## 2026-09-16 — April one-photo approval and refrigeration follow-up

Implemented locally: one usable photo is sufficient; 20ft container interior-only, 20ft trailer all five Drive references, and two-stall sleeper two existing interior views. 85 focused tests, 44 app tests, 26 browser checks, 651-page build and 648 service-area audit entries passed. No deployment or indexing change. See docs/phase1/APRIL_PHOTO_APPROVALS_2026-09-16.md for the source of the approval, exact scope, evidence and revised tracker totals.

## 2026-09-16 — Existing Vercel Git source and live boss portal

- Vercel project: `cc-devs/temp123`; Git settings initially showed `charlessslaranangsss-maker/Temp123`. After removing that connection, the GitHub namespace picker showed only `charlessslaranangsss-maker` plus `Add GitHub Scope`, not `Temporary-123-Inc`. The old repo was reconnected; Git settings displayed it as connected and showed a success toast.
- Production overview after restoration: Ready, alias `https://temp123-nine.vercel.app/`, immutable deployment `EibCuYz25TKKPRLVzYvrbsNQE6FP`, source `923d3f4` on personal repo main. No new deployment or org-repo connection was verified.
- Live portal `https://temp123-nine.vercel.app/seo-dashboard/` loaded and changed from running to `Live checked 9/16/2026, 5:23:59 PM` with an enabled Refresh button. Its diagnostics tab showed Awaiting first scheduled run and missing metrics for Firestore city health, Firebase Hosting 404s, location URL failures, incomplete rows, and GSC submissions. Its Google status tab showed 0 verified indexed, 0 verified not indexed, and 25 unknown, explicitly due to absent Search Console URL Inspection evidence. Preview homepage was marked not indexable. The page warned that it is a read-only preview without owner authentication.
- Boundary: This is not proof of site-wide error-free behavior or Google indexing. Vercel overview showed 0% error rate for its displayed 6-hour window, but that metric does not cover all routes, content, external providers, or historical errors. No deployment, Git push, indexing request, or Firebase configuration change was made.

## 2026-09-16 — Batch D state route and modal alignment

- Command: `node --import tsx work/qa/batch-d-20260916/audit.mjs` (exit 0; current source SSR, not stale `dist`).
- Scope/result: 94 routes — Minnesota 11, Mississippi 11, Missouri 13, Montana 11, Nebraska 11, Nevada 11, New Hampshire 13, New Jersey 13. These comprise 8 state pages, 43 region pages, 43 city-directory pages, and zero city-detail pages in this batch.
- Modal result: 16 logical presentations, compact and full-map for each state, with 24 rendered state-guide copies checked. Zero missing/multiple page H1s, missing immediate leads, or equipment-family conflicts were reported. Directory leads correctly describe their navigation purpose.
- Review-needed shared wording: region labels can repeat state (`Northwest Minnesota, Minnesota`; `Central Mississippi, Mississippi`); generic introduction grammar can be awkward (`Arrange temporary laundry facilities long-term rental`); a generated kitchen H1 can read `Kitchen Emergency Trailer Rental`. Sent to BOSS task for the active shared-template owners. These were not treated as a pass on copy quality.
- Boundary: This verifies current React SSR output only, not the built static output, responsive browser rendering, or deployed site. No production source edit, build, commit, push, or deployment was performed by Batch D.
## 2026-09-17 — Batch D service-area alignment (local, shared checkout)

- Scope: Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire and New Jersey; 94 registered routes (8 state guides, 43 regions, 43 city directories, 0 city-detail routes) and 16 logical state-modal presentations (24 rendered guide copies across homepage and `/service-areas/`).
- Source-rendered audit: `node --import tsx work/qa/batch-d-20260916/audit.mjs` exited 0 with `problemCount: 0` after checking one H1, equipment-family lead, modal heading/lead, and the corrected state-specific focus/summary. `npm run typecheck` exited 0.
- Corrected: Mississippi and Nebraska sleeper-modal focus headings; Montana modular-kitchen modal supporting summary. No route, canonical, indexing directive, shared template, commit, push or deployment change.
- Boundary: This is source-rendered validation, not a fresh integrated build or live desktop/mobile check. Coordinator owns final integrated release verification.


## Description-only H1 audit — 2026-09-17

Completed locally only, no deploy. 651 rendered pages and 100 logical map presentations audited; 651 H1s unchanged; 34 rental-intent description corrections. Browser: 651 page visits, 200 modal viewport checks, 84 responsive page checks, 46 query viewport checks, 4 map clicks, 0 failures/errors. Build/typecheck pass; 216 targeted + 44 application tests pass. Only two production files changed: src/alignedIntroductions.ts and content/aligned-page-introductions.json. Report and exact before/after CSV: work/qa/h1-description-only-20260917/REPORT.md and description-changes.csv. 7,700-query exhaustive re-navigation not claimed. Root dist and previous work preserved.


## 2026-09-17 Panhandle lease terms — LIVE VERIFIED

The Oklahoma Panhandle 30 ft laundry trailer and 20 ft laundry container captions now include rental or lease and weekly/monthly/yearly rental terms. Live alias temp123-nine.vercel.app verified on dpl_6ykocrDRHboUz1zNH2Em9b164U5Q. Both tabs and all four images decoded at desktop/mobile (eight image displays), zero content/browser/overflow failures. Preservation: 651 H1s/intros and 100 map presentations unchanged. Current tests: 209 targeted + 44 application pass; build 651 pages + 404. Preview noindex preserved. Separate primary staging was not promoted over the already-correct concurrent release. Evidence: work/qa/panhandle-lease-20260917/independent-final/REPORT.md. No further deployment is needed for this request.

**All service-area gallery captions — 2026-09-17, local review:** Updated the shared gallery caption composer with verified details for 35 image models. Existing non-Panhandle/non-Olympic galleries now lead with location, commercial use, and actual equipment, discuss weekly/monthly/yearly rental and lease options, add product-specific planning information, and end with the published 24/7 phone-assistance CTA. Approved Panhandle and Olympic captions retain priority. All 548 service-area routes and 100 map presentations passed a source-rendered caption/alt audit (572 group appearances, 1,755 images, zero issues). Fifteen focused tests and typecheck passed. Browser Vite request timed out; build/browser verification is recorded separately below when completed. No commit, push, or deployment. Review remains subject to owner acceptance.
Build finished: 651 pages + 404 prerendered. Static localhost preview at http://127.0.0.1:4315/service-areas/alabama/; 10 desktop/mobile browser checks across Alabama, Texas, Panhandle, and full/compact map presentations passed with zero image-load, caption-presence, or page-error failures. The earlier Vite dev server timed out, so review should use port 4315 while its local server runs.
## 2026-09-17 missing service-area galleries — local

`node --import tsx work/qa/service-area-gallery-copy-20260917/audit.mjs`: 548 routes plus 100 map presentations; all 648 contain image groups; 1,434 groups, 5,325 images, zero caption/image/alt/rental/CTA issues. `npm run build`: typecheck, Vite, 651 prerendered pages plus 404 passed. Current-source focused suites: 157 assertions passed; Vitest also discovered an archived QA snapshot under `work/qa` that fails because its copied `QuoteForm.tsx` has no `../server/schema` in the snapshot. Browser on port 4315: Arkansas 2 tabs/2 captions/6 images; Arkansas Ozarks cities 3 tabs/3 captions/13 images; second tab selected successfully on both. No live deployment test.
## 2026-09-17 four urgent equipment-photo improvements — local

`npx vitest run tests/locationCarouselImages.test.ts tests/ownerImageRollout.test.tsx tests/serviceAreaGalleryCopy.test.ts --exclude 'work/**'`: 87/87 pass. `npm run typecheck` passed. `npm run build` passed with 651 pages + 404 prerendered. Service-area render audit: 548 routes plus 100 map presentations; 648/648 have groups, 1,544 groups, 5,697 image appearances, zero issues. Port 4315 browser: Arkansas kitchen 2 tabs/7 images, Alaska ADA 2 tabs/6 images, Florida sleeper 2 tabs/3 images, Alabama shower 1 group/6 images. Selected second tabs where present; first and second group images decoded and had positive natural width. No deployment verification.

## 2026-09-17 — Homepage Restroom card photo

- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; static HTML generated for 651 pages plus 404.
- `npx playwright test tests/browser/service-hero-carousel.spec.ts --grep "uses the approved shower photo" --reporter=line`: 1 passed. Checks the homepage shower and Restroom cards, truthful image label, and decoded image width.
- Local preview at `http://127.0.0.1:4315/` refreshed and showed the Restroom card photo and combination-unit disclosure.
- Separate targeted Vitest command encountered an archived duplicate test under `work/qa/.../before/` with a missing import; the current homepage browser test passed.


## 2026-09-18 — Equipment-photo placeholder removal (local)

- `npx vitest run --exclude "work/**" tests/serviceHeroImages.test.ts tests/ServiceHeroCarousel.test.tsx tests/servicesCardPhotos.test.tsx tests/ownerImageRollout.test.tsx tests/allPageAlignment.test.tsx`: **77/77 passed**. This includes all 24 service-model routes and all 25 catalogue entries having at least one reviewed image.
- `npm run typecheck`: **passed**.
- `npm run build`: **passed**; 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 prerendered.
- Generated HTML scan for `PHOTO REVIEW IN PROGRESS`, `Exact equipment photography is pending verification`, `Verified photography coming soon`, and `Verified equipment photo pending`: **0 files failed / 652 generated pages checked**.
- Targeted Playwright checks: **5/5 passed**. The checks opened every registered model/catalogue gallery and full-image view, exercised all Services/equipment-directory/homepage quick views and reset behavior, and verified the disclosed 26 ft bulk and ADA representative galleries.
- Production deployment: commit `970a287` deployed from `main` to `https://temporary123.com`.
- Live HTML checks: `/services/`, the 26 ft bulk kitchen route, 12 ft refrigeration route, stair-rental route, dining-structure route and `/equipment-rental/` returned HTTP 200 with **0 pending-photo phrases**. Route-specific disclosure markers were present on the five directly rendered samples; the equipment-directory disclosure was verified after opening its modal.
- Production Playwright checks: **5/5 passed** against `https://temporary123.com`. They opened every registered model/catalogue gallery and full-image view, exercised all 27 Services/equipment-directory/homepage quick-view openings and reset behavior, and rechecked the 26 ft bulk and ADA representative galleries.

## 2026-09-18 — Contact Us facility options

- `npx vitest run tests/contactFacilities.test.tsx tests/contact.test.ts tests/calculator.test.ts`: **29/29 passed**. The new option labels/values render and the request schema accepts all five values.
- `npx playwright test tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts`: **1/1 passed**. Chromium opened the actual Contact Us drawer and selected Dishwashing, Refrigeration, Sleeper, Laundry, and Sink in turn.
- `npm run typecheck`: **passed**.
- `npm run build`: **passed**; 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 prerendered.
- Production HTML: `https://temporary123.com/contact-us/` returned HTTP 200 and contained all five new option values after commit `566b495` reached the Vercel alias.
- Production browser: `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://temporary123.com npx playwright test tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts`: **1/1 passed**; Chromium opened the live drawer and selected all five choices.
- Boundary: no synthetic inquiry was submitted because the reported defect concerned option visibility and selection, not downstream message delivery.

## 2026-09-18 — Inventory Restroom/Laundry correction

- Live pre-change audit of the 13 owner-reported product routes: **26/26 desktop/mobile presentations passed**. Each returned HTTP 200, rendered one visible service carousel with a decoded lead image, contained zero pending-photo phrases and produced zero console errors.
- Confirmed shared-menu defects: Restroom listed five shower/restroom combination models; Laundry listed only the 24 ft and 30 ft trailers.
- `npx vitest run tests/serviceMenuFix.test.tsx tests/seasonal.test.ts tests/imagePlacementScope.test.tsx`: **22/22 passed**.
- `npm test`: **44/44 passed**.
- `npm run typecheck`: **passed**.
- `npm run build`: **passed**; 651 pages plus the draft/noindex 404 prerendered.
- Local Chromium audit at 1440x1000 and 390x844: **2/2 menu presentations**, **4/4 family-list checks**, **4/4 gallery presentations**, and **4/4 lead images** passed with zero console errors. Restroom contains four restroom-only routes; Laundry contains all four requested choices. Both new Laundry anchors resolve on the existing category URL.
- Broader `tests/aprilPhotoPolicy.test.tsx` run: **6/7 passed**; its unrelated `Commercial Modular Kitchen` hold assertion expects zero images although the current registry returns seven. No modular-kitchen source was changed by this task.
- Production: commit `29ecf4b` was pushed only to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` main. Vercel deployment `dpl_Dop5EkVtcSjgRgoDqj7pXMXGdXkP` reached READY and the production project aliases updated.
- Live Chromium on `https://temporary123.com`: **2/2 desktop/mobile menu presentations**, **4/4 family-list checks**, **4/4 new Laundry gallery presentations**, and **4/4 decoded lead images** passed with zero console errors.
- Live post-release recheck of all 13 reported product routes: **26/26 desktop/mobile presentations passed**, with HTTP 200, one visible carousel, a decoded lead image, zero pending-photo panels and zero console errors.

## 2026-09-18 — Legacy backlink URL parity and controlled indexing release

- Input inventory: **153/153 unique absolute URLs**, **105 unique paths**, **48 duplicate host/protocol rows**, from the supplied old-site backlink export.
- Live pre-change crawl: **148/153** rows ended at HTTP 200 and **5/153** ended at HTTP 404. The five failures represented three unique paths. Every successful final page returned `noindex,follow` and no canonical.
- Local parity audit after repair: **153/153 passed**, **0 failed**. This covers exact source-path recognition, permanent path mapping where applicable, built final HTML, `index,follow`, apex self-canonical, and production sitemap membership.
- Route result: **24 direct rows**, **129 redirected rows**, **23 unique canonical destinations**. The controlled release contains exactly **25 indexable pages**: those authority destinations plus the Services and Service Areas hubs.
- `npm test`: **45/45 passed** across six files.
- `npm run build`: passed; **651 pages plus 404** prerendered in production mode.
- `npm run check:release`: passed.
- `npm run check:links`: **651 pages / 0 casing issues**.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run check:seo`: completed and confirmed **25 approved routes** with index/follow, self-canonicals, and sitemap entries. Its broader `launchReady:false` status remains because unrelated inherited migration-link and orphan-page findings are outside this backlink-parity repair.
- Local `npx vercel build --yes --target production` retrieved Vercel settings and production environment metadata, then stopped with `spawn cmd.exe ENOENT`. The actual remote Vercel build completed successfully and produced READY deployment `dpl_CLEabVTivoctpYLbKg23TV39QURD` from commit `4df32c3`.
- Repository boundary: the implementation revisions through `4df32c3` were pushed only to `https://github.com/Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123.git` on `main`.
- Live post-release crawl of all **153/153** supplied source URLs: **153 passed / 0 failed**, covering 105 unique paths and 23 unique final URLs. Every final response was HTTPS apex HTTP 200, every redirect hop was permanent, the longest chain was two hops, and no loop was found.
- Live destination metadata: **23/23** emitted `index,follow`, an exact apex self-canonical, and membership in the production sitemap. `https://temporary123.com/sitemap.xml` returned HTTP 200 with exactly **25 URLs**, and `robots.txt` returned HTTP 200 and declared that sitemap.
- Indexing controls: non-batch `/contact-us/` remained `noindex,follow` without a canonical; the Vercel preview alias returned `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, follow`.
- Boundary: these checks prove the production routing and indexability state observed at `2026-09-18T10:54:55Z`. They do not prove that Google has recrawled or indexed the URLs. The broader inherited migration-link and orphan-page findings reported by `check:seo` remain outside this scoped 153-URL repair.
- Evidence: `audit/legacy-backlink-parity-2026-09-18/live-postchange.csv`, `live-postchange.json`, `live-summary.json`, and the generated indexing registries under `audit/`.
- Final owner-requested redeployment: verified `HEAD` and `origin/main` at `57826de`, verified `origin` as `https://github.com/Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123.git`, and deployed to the already-linked Vercel project `cc-devs/temp123`. Deployment `dpl_5Ab6Vrj2byjT59y3iAKXqdy2PCTJ` reached READY and updated the production project aliases.
- Custom-domain release check: `https://temporary123.com/` returned HTTP 200 from Vercel and served the exact JavaScript and CSS asset hashes generated by that deployment. Representative repaired legacy URLs, `sitemap.xml`, and `robots.txt` also returned HTTP 200.
- Final production Playwright: `tests/browser/contact-facilities.spec.ts` plus `tests/browser/equipment.spec.ts` passed **7/7** against `https://temporary123.com`, covering all five requested Contact Us choices, all 25 equipment entries and legacy destinations, responsive catalogue images/search at four viewport widths, and mobile equipment-brief navigation.

## 2026-09-18 — All registered service pages, placeholder and image QA

- Inventory: 30 registered `/services/` routes, comprising the hub, 28 detail routes and one category route.
- Initial production browser audit: 52/60 desktop/mobile presentations passed. The 12 ft, 14 ft, 20 ft and 30 ft restroom detail URLs had no carousel in both viewports; the sweep found zero visible placeholder phrases, pending-photo elements, broken image responses or console errors.
- Root cause: four permanent redirect entries bypassed the registered detail pages, and those pages had no approved image reference if rendered directly.
- Repair: removed only those four stale redirects and reused the reviewed three-image restroom-only interior set. Each page visibly states that the images do not establish its separate length, stall count or floor plan and asks the customer to confirm dimensions, accessibility, utilities and rental or lease configuration.
- Automated checks: 118/118 focused assertions passed; the wider application run passed 119/119; TypeScript passed.
- Build: production prerender generated 655 pages plus 404, adding the four restroom detail pages.
- Local browser audit: 60/60 presentations passed at 1440x1000 and 390x844. Results: zero placeholder occurrences, zero pending-photo elements, zero broken images and zero console errors.
- Production: commit `9cbbb23` was pushed only to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` main. Vercel deployment `dpl_6zdBW8NDmn74u7ednjnu9vSWSwgq` reached READY on the linked `cc-devs/temp123` project.
- Final `https://temporary123.com` browser repeat: 60/60 presentations passed at 1440x1000 and 390x844. All 30 routes returned HTTP 200 after navigation; zero placeholder occurrences, pending-photo elements, broken images or console errors were observed. The four repaired restroom pages each rendered the reviewed three-image set as one active image plus five carousel thumbnails.
- Final wording follow-up: replaced the remaining 12 ft restroom `pending specification` planning bullet with a direct request to confirm the available unit's equipment list and floor plan. The focused suite passed **109/109**, TypeScript passed, and the production build generated **655 pages plus 404**.
- Expanded final audits now reject `pending specification` in addition to the existing photo-placeholder phrases. Local static preview passed **60/60** desktop/mobile presentations. Production deployment `dpl_D26jRZbUsCLLp5nDGFjpPSZDG5st` reached READY from commit `0b59eac`; `https://temporary123.com` then passed **60/60**, with **0** placeholder occurrences, **0** pending elements, **0** broken images and **0** console errors at `2026-09-18T12:21:22.909Z`.


## 2026-09-18 — Exact legacy backlink-path restoration, live verified

- Scope: 153 backlink-export rows, 105 unique paths, 104 HTML paths and one legacy image asset path.
- Restoration: all 104 HTML paths generate exact-path HTML; 90 were restored from redirects as useful planning pages and all 90 have a crawlable link from their related parent page. The image asset retains a permanent redirect to `https://temporary123.com/food-services-2/`.
- Indexing: 25 backlink-ranked HTML paths passed `index,follow`, exact self-canonical and sitemap checks. The other 79 exact HTML paths passed `noindex,follow`, absent-canonical and absent-sitemap checks for the controlled rollout.
- Automated tests: `npm test` passed 49/49 across seven files, including exact same-path `www` to apex coverage for every HTML backlink path.
- Build: `npm run build` passed and generated 745 pages plus 404. The existing mixed JSON import-attribute and Rollup annotation warnings remain non-fatal.
- Generated-output audit: `python scripts/audit-legacy-url-restoration.py` passed all 153 source rows with `errors: []`.
- Local mobile browser QA: three restored exact URLs returned HTTP 200 without redirect, displayed the expected H1, emitted the expected canonical and robots values, and had no horizontal overflow. The workforce parent page exposed 22 restored internal links including the Alaska URL.
- Production deployment: commit `b0b1c01` was pushed only to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` main. Vercel project `temporary-124/temporary-123` deployed it as READY production deployment `dpl_2miCSP8VjRzEegTukoQ99iTQDTu4` and aliased `temporary123.com` plus `www.temporary123.com`.
- Live URL audit: **153/153** source rows passed; **104/104** unique HTML paths returned the exact HTTPS apex path with HTTP 200; **25/25** pilot pages had `index,follow`, self-canonical and sitemap membership; **79/79** staged pages had `noindex,follow` with no canonical or sitemap entry; **1/1** legacy asset redirected permanently; and **90/90** related parent links were present. `errors: []`.
- Host redirect evidence: `https://www.temporary123.com/remote-workforce-housing-services-in-alaska/` returned HTTP **308** directly to the identical apex path.
- Production browser QA: four representative legacy routes at desktop 1440x900 and mobile 390x844 passed **8/8**. Every presentation returned HTTP 200 at its exact route, rendered a non-empty H1 and title, matched the expected robots/canonical policy, had no horizontal overflow, and emitted zero console or page errors.
- Evidence: `audit/legacy-url-restoration-2026-09-18/migration-map.csv`, `build-verification.json`, `live-verification.json`, `live-results.csv`, and `browser-verification.json`.
- Boundary: Google recrawl and index inclusion are external and were not claimed. The 79 later-batch pages intentionally remain `noindex,follow` until a separately approved controlled release.

## 2026-09-18 — Production Contact Us and calculator inquiry recovery

- Root cause: inquiries were disabled in production; the browser integration depended on build-time `VITE_*` values not present in the owner environment; and the global trailing-slash rule redirected extensionless serverless POST routes before their handlers ran.
- Repair: enabled inquiries, moved the non-secret Firebase/App Check browser settings behind `/api/public-config.json`, and submitted inquiries to `/api/contact.json`. Added physical `.json` functions for contact, delivery and SEO endpoints so Vercel does not redirect these requests.
- Credential handling: Firebase Admin accepts a full PEM private key or the full PEM encoded as base64. It rejects a truncated key or a value missing the BEGIN/END boundaries. Resend and Firebase private credentials remain server-only.
- Prior live acceptance on deployment `dpl_9WBaMyKsM9n5iUBDz7Qm8rCq19mM`: Contact Us displayed the saved-success state and reset; the rental calculator produced the expected `$5,990` result without sending during calculation, then displayed saved-success after the explicit quote request. Production logs recorded HTTP 201 for both `/api/contact.json` requests with no `delivery_pending`; this proves provider acceptance, not recipient inbox receipt.
- Durability issue found during acceptance: newer Vercel Git deployments from organization `main` omitted the uncommitted repair and overtook the verified deployment. This branch persists the repair in the organization repository so later automatic deployments retain it.
- Automated verification on the clean branch: `npm test` passed **54/54** across eight files; `npm run build` passed TypeScript, Vite bundling and prerendering of **745 pages plus 404**.
- Git-backed release: commit `d024a06` was pushed without force to `Temporary-123-Inc/Temporary-123` `main`. Vercel production deployment `dpl_sq1yeYPTj8zRwu6Sz7v7vQ1M11Zr` reached READY and owns `temporary123.com` and `www.temporary123.com`.
- Vercel build output contained both canonical and physical JSON functions, including `api/contact` and `api/contact.json`, confirming the repair is part of the authoritative source deployment rather than a temporary promotion.
- Final live checks on `https://temporary123.com`: `/api/public-config.json` returned HTTP 200 with all five required public values present; `/contact-us/` and `/rental-calculator/` returned HTTP 200; `/api/contact.json` returned 405 for HEAD and 403 for an unauthenticated POST, both with no redirect. The 403 is expected App Check enforcement and proves the POST reached the function.
- Delivery boundary: the two earlier fictional QA submissions on the same code path returned saved-success and HTTP 201, and their server executions recorded no `delivery_pending`, demonstrating Resend provider acceptance. Recipient-mailbox receipt was not independently inspected.

## 2026-09-20 — Conversion and Search Console performance measurement

- Conversion instrumentation fires only after the Contact Us or calculator request receives confirmed saved success. A client-side set deduplicates each existing idempotency key; exceptions release the key for a retry. Events carry no customer fields or custom properties.
- Search Console reads finalized web data ending three days behind: property totals, page evidence and returned-query aggregates for 28 days, plus page evidence for 90-day controlled-rollout prioritization. Branded Temporary123 variants are excluded from the known non-branded aggregate; raw queries never leave the server response.
- Response safety: all provider JSON is parsed up to a 12 MB provider boundary, then page evidence is ranked by clicks, impressions and position. The dashboard receives at most 500 28-day rows and 1,000 90-day rows while explicit available/limited counts preserve audit clarity.
- Automated verification: `npm test` passed **71/71** across 12 files; `npm run typecheck`, `npm run check:secrets`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check` passed. The build generated **745 pages plus 404**.
- Preview deployment `dpl_GQnmNDzvabG7deayZDWtK8RzE3K4` reached READY. `/api/seo-live.json` returned HTTP 200 through the Vercel protection bypass, was **286,228 bytes**, and reported Search Console `connected` with finalized dates `2026-08-21` through `2026-09-17`.
- Preview snapshot: 803 clicks, 207,857 impressions, 0.386% CTR and average position 15.88; returned-query non-brand aggregate 53 clicks and 25,548 impressions. It reported 6,069 available 28-day page rows and 17,312 available 90-day page rows while returning bounded 500/1,000 subsets. The serialized response did not contain the test raw query phrase.
- Production: commit `2c29a33` was pushed without force to official `main`; Git-triggered deployment `dpl_Bg5RKozoqu6SHLkLCGkrPDcexG2D` reached READY and owns `temporary123.com` and `www.temporary123.com`.
- Live verification: homepage, `/seo-dashboard/` and `/api/seo-live.json` returned HTTP 200. The live API was 286,226 bytes with the same connected metrics and no raw-query test phrase. Chromium rendered the organic visibility heading and the 803-click, 207,857-impression and 53-known-non-brand-click values with zero console or page errors.
- Boundary: no inquiry was submitted. Unit tests verify post-save event calls, but receipt in Vercel Analytics requires a later real or explicitly authorized QA submission.
# 2026-09-22 source backup checkpoint

`git bundle verify`, isolated `git clone --no-checkout`, and `git fsck --full` passed for candidate f702c63. Restored HEAD matched exactly. Bundle SHA256 and current production deployment recorded in `D:\Temporary123-backups\20260922-indexability\README.md`. `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/main` remained 4d05061. `vercel inspect https://temporary123.com --scope temporary-124` reported existing READY dpl_9FTCs4vGPZCd2nfDRAbabsK1N3oZ. `npm run check:release` failed with unresolved release controls. No Firebase restore, deployment, or live indexability change claimed. C: free space was zero; Cloud SDK logging failed. No cleanup performed.

# 2026-09-22 public indexability production release

- Source: official `main` fast-forwarded from `4d05061` to `f702c63`; no unrelated primary-checkout changes were included.
- Local verification: 74/74 application tests passed; the production build generated 745 registered pages plus 404; `npm run check:seo` reported `launchReady: true` with zero problems; 6/6 focused browser/HTTP tests passed; `npm run check:secrets` scanned 1,120 files with zero findings.
- Preview: deployment `dpl_CsudTUvPgNJcQPaih3apfERSWQD3` reached READY and returned preview-only `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`.
- Production: deployment `dpl_4pRgqMMvTgogKNM7VUSK7PZh1MHx` reached READY and owns `temporary123.com`, `www.temporary123.com` and the Vercel production aliases.
- Live verification: 6/6 browser/HTTP tests passed against `https://temporary123.com`, including direct HTTP 200 and indexability checks for all 744 public routes. Homepage, contact, calculator, Command Center, Houston legacy and Western Kansas samples returned HTTP 200 with `index,follow` and exact self-canonicals. The sitemap contains 744 URLs and includes the Houston and Command Center routes. `/seo-dashboard/` remains HTTP 200 with `noindex,follow` and no sitemap entry; a synthetic missing URL returned HTTP 404 with `noindex,nofollow`. `www` redirects once with HTTP 308 to the exact apex path.
- Boundary: no inquiry was submitted and no Google indexing request was sent. This proves technical crawl/index eligibility, not Google index inclusion or ranking.
- Final Git deployment: evidence commit `cae81f1` produced READY production deployment `dpl_6tR8a6kQFDZra2k7abE9GBrrBkxU`, which replaced the manual build on the apex and `www` aliases without changing runtime code. A fresh all-route live test passed 744/744 direct public HTTP 200 checks; representative exclusions and the 744-URL sitemap were rechecked afterward.
# 2026-10-11 — Oil Field Base Camps rebuild

- `vitest run tests/oil-field-rebuild.test.ts`: PASS, 2/2. Confirms all nine inventory families and the authenticated server-side Glide payload contract.
- `tsc -b`: PASS.
- Vite production build: PASS, 1,895 modules; final JS 254.06 kB (79.24 kB gzip), CSS 15.87 kB (4.01 kB gzip).
- Prerender: PASS, 16 indexable routes; sitemap contains 16 URLs; robots references the production sitemap.
- Browser: PASS on desktop homepage; single H1, Super 9 grid, footer navigation, calculator and sticky actions present.
- Browser: PASS at 390×844; no horizontal overflow; responsive header and hero render correctly.
- Contact page: PASS; one form, nine controls, no broken loaded image, no browser console warnings/errors, no overflow.
- Glide: mocked upstream submission PASS. Live submission BLOCKED because `GLIDE_WEBHOOK_URL` and `GLIDE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` are not configured in this checkout.
- Live production: NOT TESTED; no deployment performed.

## Preview deployment repair

The first Vercel build reported `conflicting_file_path` because the inherited `api/contact.ts` and the new `api/contact.js` both compiled to `/api/contact`. Removed the obsolete inherited endpoint so the validated Glide relay is the single route implementation.

# 2026-10-11 — Site-38 state/city integration

- Authoritative source copied byte-for-byte from the supplied file to `public/data/site-38-remote-workforce-housing-basecamp.json`.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run build`: passed; Vite built 1,896 modules and prerendered 313 indexable routes: 16 existing, one service-area hub, 50 state pages and 246 city pages.
- Focused Vitest: 5/5 passed across `location-data.test.ts` and `oil-field-rebuild.test.ts`.
- Integrity audit: 50/50 state records, 246/246 unique city routes, 313 sitemap URLs, zero missing generated city files, zero state-count mismatches, zero broken nearby-city targets and zero forbidden bracketed placeholders.
- Browser QA: all four deterministic hero variants rendered with one visible H1, visible description, three inventory images and location facts. Desktop Texas state page displayed all seven assigned cities. Mobile 390×844 check confirmed the variation-4 H1 and CTA with no horizontal overflow after correction.
- Static HTML verification confirmed location H1, description, breadcrumb, quote-based starting price, ETA, distance, hours and inventory family are emitted without requiring client interaction.
- Full inherited `npm test` was attempted: 260 assertions passed and three unrelated legacy redirect tests failed because the current `vercel.json` has no inherited `redirects` array; 51 stale inherited suites could not import packages absent from this focused rebuild (`cheerio`, Firebase test/admin packages and `@playwright/test`). This is recorded as an existing repository test-harness boundary; the new focused suites pass.
- No live form was submitted. Glide credentials remain unavailable in this checkout.
- Independent read-only review initially flagged unused customer/use-case/emphasis fields and inferred state-summary labels. Follow-up now renders the JSON positioning, customer types, prioritized use cases and supporting topics; orders planning modules by `equipment_emphasis`; and replaces inferred state labels with the exact JSON pricing, deployment and availability wording. Typecheck, focused 5/5 tests, 313-route build and 390×844 Texas/Fort Smith browser rechecks passed after the correction, with zero horizontal overflow.
- Git/release: implementation commit `da7df21` was pushed to `Temporary-123-Inc/oil-field-base-camps` main. Git-triggered Vercel deployment `dpl_xMV1NQfaJg65Mf6i9tqLMWyEet8W` reached READY and assigned `oil-field-base-camps.vercel.app`.
- Live preview verification: `/arkansas/fort-smith-arkansas/` returned the exact city title/H1, variation 4, visible description, three images, production-domain canonical and zero browser errors. No form was submitted.

## 2026-10-11 — Service-area responsive layout repair

- TypeScript: passed with `tsc -b`.
- Focused Vitest: 5/5 passed across `location-data.test.ts` and `oil-field-rebuild.test.ts`.
- Production build: passed; 1,896 modules built and 313 indexable routes prerendered.
- Browser matrix: all four deterministic city hero variants passed at 1440, 1024, 768, 390 and 320 CSS pixels with one H1, a visible CTA, three decoded images and no horizontal overflow.
- State-page matrix: representative variation 1–4 state pages passed at 1440, 768, 390 and 320 CSS pixels; city card links remained visible and usable. A 320-pixel contact-heading overflow found during QA was corrected and rechecked at zero overflow.
- Desktop H1 scale now resolves to 44.64px at 1440px for the tested long titles; tablet resolves to 38.4px at 768px; mobile resolves to 35.1px at 390px and 31.2px at 320px.
- Side-by-side desktop galleries no longer stretch to match long city descriptions. Tested variation-4 media is 408px high at 1440px, and galleries recompose to bounded 16:7 or 4:3 layouts at narrower breakpoints.
- Scope boundary: no JSON, routing, content, pricing, ETA, breadcrumb, link, form behavior or lead-delivery code was changed.
- Independent review: three grid-composition findings were resolved. Variants 1/3 fact grids now remain 275px high instead of stretching beyond 850px; variation 4 spans its full 1200px information row at desktop; variation 2/4 tablet fact rows and CTA stack to a single column at 1024px and 768px.
- Production: commit `1784cc5` produced READY deployment `dpl_D1NgLPpVBQ1WxVdBNdeQtkv7WN6p`. Live 1440px checks covered city variations 1–4; live 320px Arkansas state and 390px Fort Smith checks confirmed responsive type, CTA visibility, decoded media and zero horizontal overflow. The initially deferred Lafayette lazy image decoded after its gallery entered the viewport.

## 2026-10-11 — Whole-site above-the-fold and responsive audit

- Production build inventory: 313 HTML outputs and 313 sitemap URLs. All 297 prerendered location pages contain exactly one static H1; the 16 core pages render exactly one H1 through the existing client entry. No page has multiple H1s, forbidden bracketed placeholders, missing title/description metadata or broken emitted internal targets.
- Core browser matrix: 17 core URLs × five viewports (1440×900, 1024×900, 768×900, 390×667 and 320×568) = 85 passing presentations. Each had one H1, no horizontal overflow, no broken loaded image, and a visible unobscured primary CTA inside the opening viewport.
- Location browser matrix: all four deterministic variants passed at desktop, tablet and mobile. Longest city H1 (Fayetteville, North Carolina), longest city description (Columbia, Missouri), longest state H1 (North Carolina) and longest state description (Wyoming) passed at 1440, 768 and 320px with no overflow or broken images.
- Short-screen evidence: at 320×568 the Home CTA ends at 568px and Service Areas CTA at 561px. The fixed quick-action bar is inert and visually absent at initial load, then becomes visible after scrolling; it no longer overlaps the opening CTA. Fort Smith’s mobile CTA ends at 473px, facts begin at 523px and media begins at 764px after compact recomposition.
- Typography evidence: sampled core H1s now range from 28px on a 320px short screen to approximately 66px at 1440px; location H1s range from 27.2px at 320px to 44.64px at 1440px.
- TypeScript, focused Vitest 5/5 and the production build passed. The build prerendered 313 routes. No live inquiry was submitted and no JSON facts, pricing, ETA, routes or lead-delivery code changed.
- Independent read-only review identified and then rechecked mobile first-viewport CTA collisions, long-description location-grid distortion, buried facts/media and hidden sticky-control focusability. All findings were corrected; final review reported no remaining actionable findings.
- Production: commit `c94b7b2` produced READY deployment `dpl_BmD9UexDQM4BNHX5rk1ZbxRfRT79`. Live checks on the canonical Vercel URL covered homepage desktop/320×568, remote-workforce inventory 320×568, Service Areas 320×568, Lafayette variation 1 desktop, and Fort Smith variation 4 desktop/320×568. Every sample had one H1, zero horizontal overflow, zero broken loaded images and an unobscured CTA; mobile sticky controls were correctly hidden on initial load.

## 2026-10-13 — Texas local rental team section

- Scope: Texas state guide and the seven Texas city pages only.
- `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -b`: passed.
- `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/texas-office.test.ts tests/location-data.test.ts`: 2 files, 6 tests passed.
- `node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build` plus `node scripts/prerender.mjs`: passed; 313 indexable routes prerendered (50 states, 246 cities).
- Exact source verification passed for the supplied name, Jacksonville address, `tel:+18883855965`, Maps URL, review place identifier, Texas-only state/city gates and Google Maps CSP allowance.
- Placeholder scan passed for the forbidden policy/delivery/service placeholders. `git diff --check` passed (line-ending notices only).
- The in-app browser refused localhost attachment under its URL safety policy. No bypass was attempted.
- Commit `0b18b59` reached READY production deployment `dpl_41jUr1uhmRBFZs2GFDzbtUupXsXn` and owns `oil-field-base-camps.vercel.app`.
- Live desktop Texas state QA showed exactly one section with the supplied name, address, phone, Maps link and review link; the Google iframe loaded its map document and visibly rendered the Jacksonville map.
- Live 390×844 Austin city QA showed exactly one section, a 339.8×254.9 px bounded map, `tel:+18883855965`, and no horizontal overflow (`scrollWidth` 375 at a 390 px viewport).
- Live 390 px Arkansas control QA showed zero `.texas-office` elements and no horizontal overflow. No forms or third-party review actions were submitted.

## 2026-10-13 — Sitewide GMB LocalBusiness schema

- Scope: the single JSON-LD identity block inherited by every prerendered route; no visible page content, routing, metadata, canonicals, sitemap policy or form behavior changed.
- `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -b`: passed.
- `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run tests/local-business-schema.test.ts tests/oil-field-rebuild.test.ts`: 2 files, 7 tests passed.
- `node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build` plus `node scripts/prerender.mjs`: passed; 313 indexable routes prerendered.
- Rendered-output audit: 313/313 `dist/**/index.html` files contain exactly one `LocalBusiness` with the supplied name, phone, street address, logo and image; zero mismatches.
- Negative assertions passed: no standalone duplicate `Organization`, `AggregateRating`, `priceRange`, or `openingHours` in the active JSON-LD source or rendered HTML.
- Production deployment and live raw-HTML verification remain pending at this checkpoint. Structured data supports entity clarity and eligibility but does not guarantee rankings or rich results.
